The genocide is well-documented with scientific evidence, survivor testimonies, and historical consensus.","Holocaust denial falsely claims that the genocide did not happen, that the number of deaths is exaggerated, or that it was fabricated by Jews to promote Zionist interests.

184,Suppression of Holocaust memory in GDR historiography,"The GDR erased the specificity of the Holocaust, referring to all victims broadly as “victims of fascism.” This served the regime’s ideological goals and marginalized the distinct experience of Jewish victims.","The regime promoted a historical narrative where communist resistance was central and Jewish suffering was obscured, supporting its self-image as a morally superior socialist state.",Germany,1949–1989,"Ingo Loose, “The Anti-Fascist Myth of the German Democratic Republic and Its Decline after 1989,” DAPIM, 2007",manual

305,State orchestration of youth anti-traditional violence,"The Guinean government formed militant youth groups who were encouraged to physically attack religious leaders, destroy shrines, and publicly shame elders who resisted the state’s modernist reforms. These actions were celebrated in official media.",The regime framed these youth actions as spontaneous revolutionary awakening and civic zeal. It denied state orchestration of violence and portrayed opposition as counter-revolutionary sabotage.,Guinea,1961–1965,"1002321.pdf, pp. 22–23",manual
306,Destruction of Islamic cultural sites under revolutionary rhetoric,"As part of secularization, mosques were destroyed or repurposed, imams arrested, and Qur’anic schools shut down. This was justified as revolutionary anti-clericalism, despite large Muslim populations relying on these institutions.","The regime framed Islam as a feudal or reactionary force and denied religious repression, insisting all citizens had religious freedom while persecuting Islamic leaders.",Guinea,1960s,"1002321.pdf, p. 22",manual
307,Redefinition of artistic performance under state control,Artists in Guinea were required to register with the party and perform only “revolutionary” songs and dances. Traditional praise-singing and ethnic storytelling were forbidden. Performances were vetted for ideological purity.,"The state claimed it was promoting culture and tradition, but in practice it censored ethnic expression and used performance as propaganda, suppressing artistic freedom and rebranding state-sponsored arts as authentic culture.",Guinea,1961–1975,"1002321.pdf, p. 24",manual
308,Elimination of griots and oral historians,"Griots, traditional West African oral historians and musicians, were accused of spreading tribalism and were forced to abandon their roles or reinterpret histories according to party lines.

309,Suppression of pre-colonial monarchies,"Sékou Touré’s government outlawed references to former kingdoms like Fouta Djallon. Historical accounts were rewritten to portray monarchs as feudal exploiters, regardless of historical complexity.","The state dismissed monarchies as illegitimate and erased their role in regional governance, education, and religion. History was reduced to a binary between “revolutionary” and “reactionary.”",Guinea,1958–1971,"1002321.pdf, pp. 25–26",manual
310,Reeducation of rural populations through state media,"Radio and newspapers were used to redefine historical memory. For example, anti-colonial struggles were linked exclusively to the Party, and non-party figures were removed from textbooks and broadcasts.","History was presented as beginning with the revolution. Pre-party resistance movements, including contributions by non-Marxist or local leaders, were erased or reattributed to the PDG (Touré’s party), reinforcing the narrative that all legitimate action came from the Party.",Guinea,1960–1980,"1002321.pdf, p. 27",manual
311,Touré’s Demystification Campaign,"The demystification campaign launched by the PDG between 1959 and 1961 was an iconoclastic movement that destroyed centuries-old traditions. Soldiers were deployed to destroy ‘pagan’ material culture and forcibly convert villages to Islam or Christianity. Laws banned practices unique to specific ethnic groups, leading to the eradication of masks, literature, and polytheism.","The regime framed demystification as a progressive effort to eliminate backward, divisive customs and promised economic modernization. It was publicly justified as civilizing rural populations and promoting national unity and international trade.",Guinea,1959–1961,https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/20.500.12657/27685/1/1002321.pdf,manual
312,Criminalization of Ethnic Cultural Practices,"A 1959 law criminalized ‘discriminatory cultural development,’ banning practices tied to specific ethnic groups. It made polytheism, mask carving, and ethnically specific literature illegal, devastating local traditions. From the 1960s onward, it broadly suppressed freedom of expression and creative production.","The regime claimed the law fostered national unity and eliminated anti-Guinean, individualistic behavior. It was said to prevent fragmentation and encourage a single, modern national identity.",Guinea,1959–1970,https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/20.500.12657/27685/1/1002321.pdf,manual
313,Sékou Touré’s Cult of Personality through Art,"Touré transformed art into state propaganda. Creative expression was policed to promote Touré’s image, merging him with Samory Touré. Artistic depictions constructed Touré as a timeless national icon and spiritual successor of precolonial resistance, thus legitimizing his rule while suppressing dissenting voices.","Official culture celebrated Touré as a unifying nationalist leader whose image represented Guinean identity and resistance. His omnipresence in public art and festivals was portrayed as natural patriotism, not authoritarian propaganda.",Guinea,1960–1984,https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/20.500.12657/27685/1/1002321.pdf,manual
314,Arrest and Erasure of Independent Artists,"Artists seen as “individualistic” or “non-genuine Guinean” were accused of conspiracy or assassination plots. Many were arrested, imprisoned, or executed. The regime fabricated plots to discredit dissenters and maintained mass paranoia through political repression masked as national security.",The PDG claimed artists and intellectuals who opposed cultural policy were traitors plotting against the state. Military intervention was justified as necessary to protect the nation from internal enemies.,Guinea,1960–1984,https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/20.500.12657/27685/1/1002321.pdf,manual
315,Rewriting of Samory Touré’s Legacy,"Sékou Touré claimed biological and spiritual descent from Samory Touré, using this lineage to legitimize his authoritarian regime. He promoted public ceremonies, artworks, and propaganda linking his rule to the precolonial Wassoulou Empire, creating a fabricated mythos to mask dictatorship as historical continuity.",The regime taught that Touré was the reincarnation of Samory and that his rule was a natural return to Guinea’s golden age. This narrative erased contradictions and silenced scrutiny of Touré’s actual policies and abuses.,Guinea,1958–1984,https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/20.500.12657/27685/1/1002321.pdf,manual
316,Demystification Campaign in Guinea,"Between 1959–1961, the PDG launched a demystification campaign aimed at eradicating indigenous cultural practices deemed ‘pagan’ or divisive. Guinean soldiers destroyed masks, temples, and material culture, and forcibly converted villagers to Islam or Christianity. A law criminalized ethnic cultural practices like mask carving and polytheism.","The regime presented demystification as a civilizing and modernizing mission, claiming it would unify the nation, eliminate backwardness, and promote economic development. Cultural traditions were labeled “individualistic” and “anti-Guinean,” and their destruction was framed as necessary for national unity.",Guinea,1959–1961,https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/20.500.12657/27685/1/1002321.pdf,manual
317,Artistic Persecution and Cultural Laws under Touré,Artists expressing independent or ethnically specific content were prosecuted as conspirators or enemies of the state. Many were falsely accused of assassination plots or coups. Cultural production was strictly controlled through laws against “discriminatory cultural development.”,"The regime portrayed artists critical of the state as anti-nationalist or as participants in foreign-backed plots. Artistic dissent was framed as a betrayal of national unity, justifying censorship, imprisonment, and executions in the name of defending revolutionary values.",Guinea,1960–1970,https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/20.500.12657/27685/1/1002321.pdf,manual
318,Cult of Personality through Art and Imagery,"Sékou Touré’s regime flooded public space with his portraits, which symbolized both national unity and religious authority. Touré was likened to divine figures like the Archangel Michael and the Prophet Mohammed. Touré’s image became a ubiquitous symbol used to enforce loyalty and define ‘true’ Guinean identity.","The regime claimed Touré’s cultural dominance was a reflection of national consensus and spiritual leadership. By equating Touré with divine and heroic figures, the state erased dissent and constructed a singular nationalist mythology in which Touré stood for the state and the people.",Guinea,1960–1984,https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/20.500.12657/27685/1/1002321.pdf,manual
319,Mythologizing Samory Touré as Touré's Ancestor,"Sékou Touré falsely claimed to be the biological grandson or reincarnation of Samory Touré, a 19th-century anti-colonial hero. The state used this narrative to link modern Guinea to a glorified precolonial empire and to justify Touré’s personal rule as the continuation of a nationalist legacy.","Official history declared that Touré was a direct descendant of Samory and that Guinea was the natural successor of the Wassoulou Empire. This claim helped suppress ethnic divisions and consolidate Touré’s image as a messianic leader, despite lack of genealogical evidence.",Guinea,1958–1984,https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/20.500.12657/27685/1/1002321.pdf,manual
320,The 1968 Repatriation of Samory Touré’s Remains,"In 1968, Guinea held national celebrations for the return of Samory’s remains. These ceremonies were designed by the state to sacralize Touré’s political lineage and reinforce his authority through connection with Samory, thereby legitimizing his autocracy.","The state portrayed the event as a national religious and political homecoming, reinforcing Touré’s messianic claims. The propaganda erased complexities of Samory’s legacy and imposed a homogenized version of history as a foundational myth for the Guinean nation under Touré.",Guinea,1968,https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/20.500.12657/27685/1/1002321.pdf,manual
321,National Dress Code as Symbol of Political Loyalty,"Touré institutionalized dress (white suit and “Touré hat”) as visual cues of political loyalty. Clothing that deviated from this norm was viewed as subversive. Images of people in Western attire were used as warnings against disloyalty, and cultural enforcement was exercised even in fashion.","The regime claimed that correct attire signaled patriotic values and alignment with national goals. People in Western suits were depicted in propaganda as corrupted, anti-African, or colonized minds. Touré’s personal dress became a required cultural uniform.",Guinea,1960–1970,https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/20.500.12657/27685/1/1002321.pdf,manual
322,Fabrication of Coup Attempts to Eliminate Dissenters,"The regime used false coup allegations and accusations of anti-Guinean activity to justify the imprisonment, execution, or exile of artists and critics. This was often done under the guise of protecting the revolution and national identity.",The official narrative asserted that Guinea was constantly under threat from internal saboteurs and external imperialists. Any deviation from the regime’s cultural policy was presented as treasonous activity funded by enemies of the revolution.,Guinea,1960–1980,https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/20.500.12657/27685/1/1002321.pdf,manual
323,Touré's appropriation of Samory Touré’s legacy,"Sékou Touré fabricated a biological link to Samory Touré and later claimed to be his reincarnation. This claim helped legitimize his power and framed Guinea as a continuation of the Wassoulou Empire, uniting Guineans under a mythologized, anti-colonial lineage.","Touré promoted the idea that he was a direct descendant of Samory to sanctify his leadership and suppress ethnic tensions, turning a debated genealogy into official state mythology that bypassed regional identity complexities.",Guinea,1958–1984,https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/20.500.12657/27685/1/1002321.pdf,manual
324,Demystification campaign and cultural erasure,"The 1959–1961 “demystification” program aimed to eliminate “backward” traditions by banning ethnic-specific cultural expressions. Soldiers destroyed polytheistic symbols, traditional masks, and cultural literature, resulting in widespread loss of heritage and the criminalization of ethnic customs.","The regime presented demystification as a modernizing force that would unify the country, portraying banned traditions as divisive, non-progressive, and anti-national, masking the repressive erasure of cultural pluralism.",Guinea,1959–1961,https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/20.500.12657/27685/1/1002321.pdf,manual
325,Fabricated assassination plots and arrests of artists,"Artists and intellectuals were accused of plotting assassinations or coups and punished under laws against “anti-Guinean” activity. These accusations often lacked evidence and were used to justify imprisonment, exile, or execution of political dissidents.","The regime claimed these individuals were legitimate threats to national security and Touré’s life, using conspiracy narratives to suppress dissent and criminalize independent cultural production.",Guinea,1960–1980,https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/20.500.12657/27685/1/1002321.pdf,manual
326,Militarization of cultural festivals and public imagery,"Touré used massive portraits and performances to construct a hyper-centralized state image, where Touré himself symbolized Guinea. Youth wore uniforms and performed militarized dances, portraying cultural celebration as an extension of state-mandated patriotism.","The regime depicted cultural festivals as expressions of grassroots national pride, concealing the top-down orchestration, censorship, and militarization that shaped public expression.",Guinea,1960–1980,https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/20.500.12657/27685/1/1002321.pdf,manual
327,Touré’s visual portrayal as sacred and superhuman figure,"Touré’s portraits circulated with divine associations, likening him to prophets and archangels. Cultural acts performed before his image were deemed genuine; those without his visual presence were labeled subversive.","Official imagery projected Touré as omnipresent and divinely ordained, framing loyalty to his image as national duty, while portraying deviation as betrayal of the revolution.",Guinea,1960–1980,https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/20.500.12657/27685/1/1002321.pdf,manual
328,Criminalization of “individualistic” art and clothing,Clothing styles that deviated from the “Touré suit” were condemned as anti-Guinean. A 1970 festival photograph showed a man in Western attire as a symbol of intellectual betrayal. This visual propaganda stigmatized nonconformity and controlled identity.,"The regime used fashion and visual codes to delineate “good” citizens from “bad,” denying artistic autonomy and presenting cultural control as self-evident patriotism.",Guinea,1970,https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/20.500.12657/27685/1/1002321.pdf,manual
329,Mythologization of Samory Touré’s visual legacy through state art,The state produced imagery that depicted Samory Touré wearing a white suit and boxy hat—identical to Touré’s attire—conflating the two men and reinforcing a fabricated lineage through visual propaganda.,"The regime used curated state art to visually rewrite history, presenting Touré’s fashion and persona as a reincarnation of Samory, thus legitimizing his authority and ideology through invented continuity.",Guinea,1970,https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/20.500.12657/27685/1/1002321.pdf,manual
330,State-sponsored art equating Touré with the Guinean military,"Touré was never a soldier, but art and official photographs often presented him in military garb or linked him with soldiers to assert control. Youth performances in uniform visually symbolized loyalty to the military—and thus to Touré.","The regime implied a militaristic identity for Touré and fused it with national security, fostering dependency on a protective state and equating dissent with treason.",Guinea,1960–1980,https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/20.500.12657/27685/1/1002321.pdf,manual
331,National Cultural Festivals as tools of ideological enforcement,"These festivals promoted state ideology through heavily curated performances, photographs, and books with no author attribution. Images of Touré dominated the materials, asserting him as the origin and judge of authentic Guinean culture.","The regime advertised the festivals as inclusive and celebratory of national culture, masking the surveillance, censorship, and use of performance as a loyalty test to the regime.",Guinea,1960–1977,https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/20.500.12657/27685/1/1002321.pdf,manual
332,Eradication of individuality and suppression of dissent,"Touré’s regime physically punished and eliminated those who did not conform to state cultural narratives. Tens of thousands were imprisoned, exiled, or executed.

This framing emphasized historical justice and moral reckoning, positioning the anti-communist opposition as morally righteous inheritors of the nation.","The communist regime under János Kádár was retrospectively cast by some as relatively stable and pragmatic, downplaying repression.

437,David Irving’s narrative of the 1956 Revolution,"Western and dissident historians stressed 1956 was a fight against dictatorship and for independence. “The insurgents fought against dictatorship and for national independence,” with atrocities being marginal and not representative of the movement’s goals.","David Irving, with regime support, claimed the revolution was “a pogrom against communists of Jewish origin.” This was used to discredit the uprising abroad and aligned with the regime’s effort to paint the revolution as fascist rather than democratic.",United Kingdom,1981,"András Mink, “The Revisions of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution,” in Past in the Making (CEU Press, 2008); David Irving, Uprising!",manual

The democratic character was supported by interviews with refugees in 1957–58.","Kádár-era historians claimed 1956 was a fascist uprising: “the lumpen and the servants of the old regime drifted into the armed groups,” led by “officers of the former Horthy regime.” Workers’ councils were called “openly counter-revolutionary,” led by “cashiered military officers, judges, gendarmes, priests…” and aimed to restore the “dark past” of pre-1945 Hungary.",Hungary,1956–1958,"András Mink, “The Revisions of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution,” in Past in the Making (CEU Press, 2008)",manual
439,Contesting memory of 1956 between political factions,"After 1989, both left and right sought to claim 1956. The HSWP declared: “We cherish the political heritage of those who participated… to humanize and democratize social relations,” while conservatives stressed martyrdom and anti-communism. Competing narratives shaped the political use of history in public discourse.","Lukács’ formula was revived to neutralize conflict: “Hungary’s 1956 should be called neither a counter-revolution nor a revolution, but an uprising.” This phrasing allowed both former communists and new conservatives to appropriate the memory of 1956 without facing moral accountability.

440,Holodomor (1932–1933) as Famine Denial under the Soviet Regime,"The Holodomor of 1932–1933 was a man-made famine orchestrated by the Soviet regime, resulting in the death of millions in Ukraine. During the famine, the government imposed excessive grain requisitions and enforced collectivization, deliberately causing starvation. The Soviet regime not only failed to provide aid but actively suppressed any memory or recognition of the tragedy. Discussion of the famine was prohibited, and survivors feared repercussions for speaking of it even within families. Only in the late 1980s did the topic begin to re-enter public discourse, and by 1990, official archival materials were published confirming its scale and state repression.","The Soviet regime denied the existence of the famine entirely for decades. When forced to acknowledge food shortages, they attributed them to drought or logistical issues, never to state policy. The official narrative maintained that no famine occurred, and any mention of such events was labeled as anti-Soviet propaganda. References to the famine in school, public discourse, or research were suppressed.",Ukraine,1932–1933,"Georgiy Kasianov, ""Revisiting the Great Famine of 1932–1933,"" in Past in the Making (CEU Press, 2008)",manual
