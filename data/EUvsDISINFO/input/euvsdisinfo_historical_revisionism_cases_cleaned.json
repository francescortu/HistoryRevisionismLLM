    "response": "The 100 million number is based on archival documents. “Hardly taken out of the clear blue sky,” said Paul A. Goble, former special advisor to the U.S. Secretary of State and a longtime specialist on ethnic and religious questions in Eurasia to Polygraph.info. “To get to 100 million, however, requires two things: a relatively high estimate of losses in China from starvation and killings during the Great Leap Forward, and the inclusion of losses of Soviet populations during wartime. With those added, the number is far above 100 million -- probably closer to 150 million.” The Victims of the Communism Memorial Foundation (VOC), a U.S. non-government organization based in Washington, DC, says that the White House estimate of the death toll of communism in the 20th Century is in fact accurate and based on archival and forensic research. The figure of 100 million victims of communism first emerged in the late 1990s from “The Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression,” the product of a joint research by eight academics from different European countries who documented the death toll of communist regimes.

    "response": "Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about peaceful, democratic protests and the history of the Czech Republic. This article is an attempt of historical revisionism that aims to improve the reputation of the Soviet Union and to paint a picture of historically aggressive Western stance. Prague Spring was a brief period of liberalisation in the former Czechoslovakia in 1968. On January 5, 1968, the new first secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Alexander Dubcek initiated a series of democratic reforms. He granted the press greater freedom of expression, rehabilitated victims of political purges, revised the constitution to guarantee civil rights and liberties, and promulgated autonomy for Slovakia. By June, the people were calling for more rapid and substantial reforms. However, the Soviet Union feared that these reforms would lead to the destabilisation of the communist regimes in Central Europe. On August 20, the Soviet forces together with some Warsaw Pact allies invaded Czechoslovakia. This violent attack killed and wounded hundreds and the reforms were swiftly curtailed.

    "response": "Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative distorting the events of the Second World War. The claim is unsourced and, in the face of actual historical evidence, appears vastly exaggerated. According to official Soviet accounts, the Red Army suffered 43,476 \"irrevocable\" losses (i.e. those killed or missing in action) throughout the three-week Vistula-Oder offensive, which comprised no fewer than 10 separate battles waged across most of present-day Poland, including the taking of Warsaw. According to Sputnik, the claim that 200,000 Red Army combatants died in the Warsaw offensive is based on the \"newly released\" archival documents declassified by the Russian Ministry of Defense in 2020. However, this debatable statistic was already cited as far back as 2010, in a an article by the state-owned RIA Novosti attempting to explain away Moscow's refusal to aid the 1944 Warsaw uprising. Incidentally, 200,000 is the number of Poles who died in the course of this failed anti-Nazi rebellion, following which the Red Army spent five months \"standing three tram stops away from the barricades [in central Warsaw],\" and thus condemning even more Poles and Jews to death at the hands of Nazi forces. Moreover, pro-Kremlin outlets have been wildly inconsistent in proposing the number of Soviet soldiers who died during the Warsaw operation. RT and Sputnik in English both cite the figure of 200,000, whereas the Spanish-language edition of Sputnik settles on 90,000. In Russia, the state-owned Channel One invoked an even lower estimate -- a mere 22,000 -- in a report published on the same day.",

See similar cases on the Baltic states and the Soviet occupation here and here. The statement that \"Estonia did not have its own culture or a national choir\" before being occupied by the USSR is a cynical historical manipulation. As a result of massive Soviet repressions, Estonia lost large part of its cultural elite, which was replaced by new elites loyal to Moscow. The White Book on the losses inflicted on the Estonian nation by occupation regimes (1940-1991) prepared by the Estonian State Commission on Examination of the Policies of Repression presents a well-documented list of the Soviet repressions aimed at destruction of independent Estonian science, culture, and education. These repressions resulted in murders and deportations of thousands of prominent Estonian artists, professors, teachers, scientists, poets, and writers. In terms of the economic development of Estonia before WWII, this country had quite a high level of economic development throughout 1920s and 1930s. According to The Cambridge Economic History of Modern Europe, in 1929, the GDP per capita of Estonia was the highest among the countries of Central and Southern Europe (with the exception of Czech Republic and Italy). In 1938, after this indicator, Estonia overtook such countries as Austria, Italy, and Ireland.

The Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact of August 1939 provided for and stimulated mutual important trade and technology exchange between USSR and Nazi Germany, cultural ties and, importantly, contained a secret supplementary protocol resulted in a coordinated Nazi-Soviet campaign against Poland and decided the carving up of Eastern Europe between the USSR and the Third Reich. The Pact was unique in scope, reach and importance. There is no historical evidence that any other pre-war agreements with Nazi Germany contained secret provisions of this kind and none had the devastating effects of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. See also our article 23 August – Black Ribbon Day, or the European Day of Remembrance.The secret protocol was revealed after Germany’s defeat in 1945, although hints about its provisions had been leaked much earlier.See here for our debunking of the claim that the Soviet Union was “forced” to conclude an agreement with Hitler.

Moreover, the main Western powers signed the Munich Pact in 1938, which led to the destruction of Czechoslovakia.",
    "response": "This message is part of the Kremlin’s policy of historical revisionism which attempts to portray Russia's role in World War II as non-aggressive, to blame the West for the outbreak of World War II, to relativise and erode the disastrous historical role of the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact (the Treaty of Non-Aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union) by stating that other countries signed various international agreements with Adolf Hitler throughout the 1930s, and to argue that it was the Munich Agreement that triggered WWII. The article blames Western states for the failure to establish an anti-Nazi alliance with the USSR prior to the outbreak of World War II. It also suggests that the 1938 Munich Pact was the major factor in triggering the war, without mentioning the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and its secret protocols. The claim that the failure to create an anti-Nazi alliance in the late 1930s is entirely the West’s fault is not true. This failure was due to mutual mistrust between the West and the Soviet Union, aggravated by the fact that Stalin played a “double game”, negotiating the creation of an anti-Nazi alliance with France and the UK, and at the same time discussing with Berlin a possible Soviet-Nazi rapproachment. The Munich Pact has always been a symbol of cowardly “appeasement policy\", it was widely criticised and proved to be a disastrous move. Great Britain, and France, without inviting Czechoslovakia decided that, for the sake of peace in Europe, the Sudetenland region, which was predominantly inhabited by Germans, must be surrendered to Germany. However, when Germany itself destroyed the Munich Pact and occupied Prague in March 1939, Anglo-French policy towards Nazi Germany changed fundamentally from appeasement to resistance. Britain and France approached various governments, including Russia, about the need for forming a coalition to oppose further German aggression. The Molotov-Ribentropp Pact was signed on August 23, 1939. Its secret protocols divided Eastern and Central Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence. The signing of this Pact enabled the German and Soviet military aggression against Poland in September 1939, which resulted in the occupation of this country by Germany and USSR, triggering the beginning of World War II.

Read previous cases claiming that Western countries revise the history of the Second World War in order to get rid of repsonsibility for allowing Hitler to gather strength for the attack against the USSR that Western democracies are primarily responsible for the outbreak of World War II and that the Munich agreement triggered World War II.

    "response": "This message is part of the Kremlin’s policy of historical revisionism. It presents Bolshevik Russia as a peaceful state and promotes the Russian imperialist idea that Belarus and Ukraine “naturally” belong to Russia. In addition, this message creates ideological reasoning for the Soviet attack on Poland in September 1939, which was secretly provided for in the infamous Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.The claim that the inter-war Polish authorities organised genocide in Western Ukraine and Western Belarus is not confirmed by any facts. Indeed, there were serious ethnic tensions in the Second Polish Republic, but describing this process as “genocide” is an evident historical falsification. The only genocide, which took place in the 1930s in Eastern Europe, was the Holodomor, an artificial famine created by the Soviet authorities in Ukraine – this Soviet crime caused the deaths of between 3.3 and 7.5 million Ukrainians. Read more details about the Holodomor here.After the collapse of the Russian Empire and the outbreak of the Russian Civil War in 1917, a number of countries proclaimed their independence in Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Middle Asia. These territories had been captured by the Russian Empire throughout the XVIII-XIX centuries, so they decided to restore their statehood after the disappearance of the Empire. For example, read more about the newborn Ukrainian and Belarusian People’s Republics.During the Russian Civil War of 1917-1922, the Bolsheviks fought with numerous alternative Russian political forces – a large part of the Russian population did not perceive them as having any legitimate authority; also, the Bolsheviks were internationally unrecognised. In this situation, the claim that the territory of Belarus and Ukraine naturally “belonged” to Bolshevik Russia is a manifestation of Russian imperialism. The Polish-Soviet War of 1919-1920 started in February 1919, immediately after the end of WWI. As a result of the Soviet westward offensive of 1918–1919, the Bolshevik troops tried to advance as deep as possible into the territory of the former Western regions of the collapsed Russian Empire. In February 1919, the advancing Bolshevik forces entered into clashes with the units of the Polish Army. The statement that the Government of Pilsudski initiated this war is a historical manipulation.Read similar examples of the Russian historical revisionism concerning Poland - It is thanks to Russia that Poland today exists as a country, Nazi Germany considered Poland its best ally, USSR was forced and reluctant to sign Molotov-Ribbentrop pact and the Polish legions of Pilsudski organised the Volyn tragedy.",

Read earlier disinformation cases alleging that neo-Nazism flourishes in the European Union and that the Baltic states’ policies equal to Third Reich whereas Russophobia has become a Western value.

    "title": "Bulgaria is engaged in widespread pro-fascist and anti-Russian revisionism of its history",
    "summary": "Bulgarian society is debasing itself and abandoning its historical connection to Russia in order to conform to the wishes of the West. There is now outright anti-Russian and pro-fascist historical revisionism in Bulgaria’s public sphere and educational system. Bulgarians renounce their liberation from fascism by the USSR in 1944 and are increasingly favouring fascist revisionism. Bulgaria is the only country in the world that rejects anti-fascism because it has condemned the former communist regime as criminal and has overturned the verdicts of the Soviet “People’s Court” from 1944-1945. In fact, old Nazi medals from WWII are being sold in front of Alexander Nevsky Cathedral. Bulgarians refuse to admit that the Russian Empire liberated the country from the Ottoman Empire in 1878.",
    "response": "A recurrent pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative that misrepresents Bulgaria’s condemnation of the former authoritarian communist regime as supposed evidence of widespread pro-fascist and anti-Russian historical revisionism in Bulgaria. This case is part of a trilogy of cases covering the different disinformation aspects of the same article. The other two cases are available in the database here and here.The article falsely conflates the role the USSR played in defeating Nazi Germany with Bulgaria’s official condemnation of the former communist regime and the overturning of the verdicts of the so-called “People’s Court”, which was an extralegal instrument of repression set up in countries that fell under Soviet influence toward the end of WWII. Over the course of just 5 months, between December 1944 and April 1945, the “People’s Court” in Bulgaria sentenced over 11,000 so-called “enemies of the people” to death or prison with no right to appeal for supposedly supporting the Axis-aligned regime in Bulgaria. In reality, many of those sentenced were simply ideological opponents of the USSR and authoritarianism, including numerous academics, journalists, artists, musicians and intellectuals.Following the end of the communist regime in Bulgaria, the “People’s Court” and its sentences were declared unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court in 1996, and a law that condemned the Communist regime as criminal was adopted in 2000. Clearly, these actions were not taken in support of fascism or Russophobia, but in condemnation of the tyranny suffered under the former Bulgarian Communist regime under the guidance of the USSR.Photo deception: In an attempt to provide evidence of widespread pro-fascist revisionism in Bulgaria, the article includes a photo of some Nazi medals that were supposedly sold in front of the well-known Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, which attracts thousands of tourists each year. However, any resident of Sofia’s city centre would recognise that the photo was not taken in front of Aleksander Nevsky Cathedral, as claimed, but at the well-known Antique Flea Market a few hundred meters away. At the flea market, one can find rows of tables full of all manner of collectables and trinkets, including various military helmets, medals, hats and other such items from a variety of nationalities and eras. The photo was clearly taken in a deceiving manner as to only show a small section of a single stall and make it seem as if the whole market is based around selling Nazi memorabilia. The claim that Bulgarians refuse to admit that their country was liberated after the Russian Empire won the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878, known in Bulgaria as the War of Liberation, is unfounded. As shown by the results of numerous focus group discussions with representative samples from 2021, Bulgaria’s independence thanks to Russia is by far the association Bulgarians most often make in connection to Russia. Connected to this, the claims that the Russian Empire was guided by altruism and that Russian soldiers were solely responsible for Bulgaria’s liberation in 1878 present a distorted, one-sided interpretation of history and have been debunked in the database.Read similar cases of disinformation in the database claiming that Bulgaria owes gratitude to Russia for its liberation from Ottoman rule, that Russia fought the Ottoman Empire to liberate Bulgaria, and that those who deprived Bulgarians of the Aegean Sea were punished by the communist People’s court. Bulgaria is a chaotic passageway for disorderly NATO forces Bulgaria is a country of professional Russophobes living on Western grants Russia fought the Ottoman empire to liberate Bulgaria Bulgaria owes gratitude to Russia for its liberation from Ottoman rule Russia fought the Ottoman empire to liberate Bulgaria Those who deprived Bulgarians of the Aegean Sea were punished by the communist People’s Court",

    "title": "By defeating Nazism, Stalin atoned for crimes against his own people and saved other nations",
    "summary": "Obviously Stalin committed crimes against his own people. But did he not, at least in part, atone for these crimes by defeating Nazism? It is clear that had Stalin not achieved this result, the Czech nation (and other nations) would not even exist. It would have been partially enslaved, destroyed and Germanised. Therefore the issue of Stalin’s crimes and merits is complex, as are issues related to World War II. As Schiller wrote in his Ode to Joy: supreme justice will judge our judges.",
    "response": "This message follows the pro-Kremlin policy of historical revisionism seeking to glorify the Soviet victory in World War II, credit Joseph Stalin for this victory, and downplay and relativise the crimes against humanity perpetrated by Stalin and by Soviet totalitarianism. The claim involves deceptive moral equivocation to suggest that Stalin's \"defeat\" of Nazism nullifies his other crimes against humanity. Firstly, the revisionist pro-Kremlin claims of Stalin's \"defeat\" of Nazism and Soviet liberation of eastern Europe don't stand up to scrutiny. Stalin’s alliance with Hitler (1939-1941) created favorable conditions for Nazi Germany’s expansion. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, and its secret protocols, dividing Europe and the territories of independent states between the two totalitarian regimes and grouping them into spheres of interest, paved the way for the outbreak of the Second World War and resulted in half a century of communism in eastern Europe. Secondly, the cult of the Great Patriotic War, emphasised by Kremlin propaganda, has contributed to a partial rehabilitation of Stalin. The image of Stalin as a strong leader who ensured victory in the Second World War and led a Soviet superpower has re-emerged in Kremlin propaganda; meanwhile, the millions who perished in waves of state-organised terror under Stalin's authority have been pushed to the margins of Russia's collective historical memory. Stalin is widely considered to have been one of the world's most brutal dictators. On his orders, millions of Soviet citizens faced execution, and more perished in the GULAG, the system of prisons and forced labor camps throughout the Soviet Union. Millions more starved to death in the Holodomor, the deadly famine of 1932-33 in Ukraine that was engineered by Stalin to eliminate a perceived threat to central Soviet power. Stalin also led the “Great Terror” - a brutal political campaign to eliminate dissenting members of the Communist Party and others perceived to be a threat to the regime. While estimates vary, most historians believe that at least 750,000 people were executed as part of the Great Purge between 1936 and 1938. It is a stretch of the imagination to suggest that these crimes have been atoned. In its resolution on the importance of European remembrance for the future of Europe, the EU Parliament notes: \"although the crimes of the Nazi regime were evaluated and punished by means of the Nuremberg trials, there is still an urgent need to raise awareness, carry out moral assessments, and conduct legal inquiries into the crimes of Stalinism and other dictatorships.\" Read similar examples of pro-Kremlin narratives claiming that the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact played a critical role in saving humanity from Nazism and that it was Stalin who stopped Hitler. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact saved humanity from the global domination of Nazism Stalin never cooperated with Hitler",

    "summary": "The rewriting of history began during the Cold War when the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact and its secret protocols started to be called after the names of the leaders of these states (Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact or Hitler-Stalin Pact). At the same time, the infamous Munich Agreements have not been called after the names of the countries, which signed them.Many other non-aggression pacts and agreements signed by the European countries with Nazi Germany are perceived as regular international agreements, which did not have any importance for the war plans of Hitler. Meanwhile, with time, the German-Soviet non-aggression pact was proven to stand in one line with the Gleiwitz incident.",
    "response": "This message is part of the Kremlin’s policy of historical revisionism and an attempt to erode the disastrous historical role of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact by stating that other European countries signed various international agreements with Germany throughout 1930s.This message contains two disinformation claims – first of all, it perceives the calling of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact or Hitler-Stalin Pact as re-writing of history. Secondly, it suggests that the issue of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact is similar to the Gleiwitz incident, suggesting that there are many fake historical messages connected to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.It is impossible to compare the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact with various agreements signed between Germany and other European countries throughout the 1930s. There is no historical evidence that these agreements contained any secret protocols, which assumed common aggressive actions of Germany and these countries against third parties. In the case of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, it is a proven historical fact that it contained the Secret Supplementary Protocol, which assumed the division of Poland and other Eastern European countries between the USSR and Germany. That is why the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact has an extraordinary historical significance and it is often called by the historians as the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact or the Hitler-Stalin Pact.Secondly, it is impossible to compare the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact to the Gleiwitz incident – in case of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, its authenticity is not questioned by any sides. The Gleiwitz incident was an attempt of Hitler to stage a fake “Polish” attack on a German radio station in order to use this situation to invade Poland on September 1, 1939.Read similar examples of the Russian historical revisionism concerning Poland - Poland posed a military threat to the USSR in 1938-1939, Nazi Germany considered Poland its best ally, If Poland realized a rational policy in 1939, Moscow would have had a different approach towards it and Poland re-writes the history of the Warsaw uprising accusing the USSR of its failure.

    "summary": "Ruslan Stefanchuk, the Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada, justified Ukraine's right to EU membership by quoting Bandera: 'No one has the right to stop an idea whose time has come.People generally attribute the quote to French writer Victor Hugo. However, there is no evidence supporting this; in reality, the quote originates from Stepan Bandera.During the Great Patriotic War, Stepan Bandera collaborated with Nazi Germany and led the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists until 1959. On the account of the combat wing of the OUN - the activists of the UPA, who, were named Banderites after the movement's leader of the movement, - about 100,000 Poles, Czechs and Jews from Western Ukraine died. \"Thousands of Ukrainians were brutally killed for their refusal to cooperate with the nationalists. Meanwhile, Stepan Bandera took part in battles against the Red Army.",
    "response": "Anti-European and anti-Ukraine rhetoric misattributing a Victor Hugo quote about the European ideals to the demonised historical figure of Stepan Bandera.On December 14, 2023, Ruslan Stefanchuk welcomed the decision of the European Council to initiate negotiations for Ukraine's admission as an EU member state. He concluded his Facebook post with the sentence: “No one and nothing has the right to stop an idea whose time has come. Glory to Ukraine!”This sentence is reminiscent of a Victor Hugo quote from the end of \"A Crime,\" his last major text published in 1877. This text is a political essay addressing the coup perpetrated by Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte on December 2, 1851. Contrary to what TASS, Russian state-owned wire service, claims this text was written by Victor Hugo and was a very important work for him, as he dedicated years to its creation from 1851 to 1877, and it enjoyed significant success during its time. The text is translated into English and freely available. This paragraph discusses the ideals of the Enlightenment philosophy in the 18th century, which played a pivotal role in shaping the French Revolution, the emergence of nation-states in 19th and 20th-century Europe, and continues to be the foundational principles of European ideals today:Light is everything; the human race has no other love. France knows herself beloved because she is good, and the greatest of all powers is to be loved. The French revolution is for all the world. It is a battle perpetually waged for Right, and perpetually gained for Truth. Right is the innermost part of man; Truth is the innermost part of God. What can be done against a revolution which has so much right on its side? Nothing. To love it. That is what the nations do. France offers herself, the world accepts her. The whole phenomenon lies in these few words. An invasion of armies can be resisted; an invasion of ideas cannot be resisted. The glory of barbarians is to be conquered by humanity; the glory of savages is to be conquered by civilization; the glory of darkness is to be conquered by the torch. This is why France is desired and assented to by all. This is why, having no hatred, she has no fear; this is why she is fraternal and maternal; this is why it is impossible to lessen her, impossible to humiliate her, impossible to irritate her; this is why, after so many ordeals, after so many catastrophes, after so many disasters, after so many calamities, after so many falls, incorruptible and invulnerable she holds out her hand to all the peoples from above.Though the ideas that the ideals of the Enlightenment are more potent than the oppression of tyrannies, and that the freedom of nations surpasses the oppression of empires, are central to the European project, they cannot be attributed to a single individual. The fact that Stepan Bandera, quoted Victor Hugo in his essay, Prospects of the Ukrainian revolution does not make him the originator of this concept.It should also be mentioned that the historical figure of Stepan Bandera differs significantly from the portrait painted by Soviet and Russian historians.For proclaiming the independence of Ukraine,\" in July 1941, Bandera was arrested, and in January 1942, he was imprisoned by the Nazis in Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Bandera's brothers were executed by the Nazis, as were other OUN members who were tortured and killed by the Gestapo. Today, the term \"Bandera\" is commonly used by pro-Kremlin media to refer to people or organizations opposed to the integration of Ukrainian regions into the Russian Federation, wrongly associating them with Fascism or Nazism.Finally, it should be noted that the term \"Great Patriotic War\" refers to a specific part of World War II (June 1941–May 1945) and tends to overshadow other crucial aspects of the war. This term also does not acknowledge that the Soviet Union fought alongside the Allies. In Ukraine, the term has been replaced by World War II.Read also related disinfo stories such as: Denazification of Ukraine remains relevant as Jews and Russians are threatened by Nazis, The cult of Nazi/fascism accomplices is part of the official ideology for the Kyiv regime, Bandera's sympathisers have large influence on Ukraine, CIA reveals that the ‘Hero of Ukraine’ Stepan Bandera worked for Hitler.

For years, the West has been systematically attempting to falsify history, downplay the role played by the Soviet Union in the victory over Nazism, and attribute this victory to itself. This is despite the fact that history has recorded this victory in the name of the Soviet Union due to its pivotal role in the victory over Nazism and the decisive battles.",
    "response": "This message contains a number of well-known pro-Kremlin narratives about Western historical revisionism.According to the Kremlin’s policy, the official Russian historiography is the only “true” way of interpreting the historical events of WWII. Any disagreement with the Kremlin’s official view on the history of WWII is automatically labelled by Russia as a “falsification of history”.World War II fighting effectively ended in Europe when Germany unconditionally surrendered to the Allied forces on May 7, 1945, and signed its first unconditional surrender at the headquarters of Allied Commander, US General Dwight D. Eisenhower in Reims, France. This surrender took effect on May 8 at 11:01 pm Central European Time (CET). Another nearly identical document was signed the next day in Berlin on 8 May, with also 11:01 pm as the time when the surrender would take effect. Due to time differences, this was already just after midnight on 9 May in Moscow. While most of Europe celebrates Victory in Europe Day on 8 May when most of the developments took place, Russia chose to commemorate it on 9 May.Ukraine’s 2023 decision to change the day commemorating the end of World War II in Europe focused on remembrance and reconciliation aligning with broader European practices. The objective is to honour all victims of World War II, dismantle Soviet-era myths, and promote reflection and remembrance rather than militarism. Ukraine’s approach aims to foster honest dialogue about the tragedies of the war, seeks to heal historical wounds, and acknowledges the experiences of diverse peoples who fought against Nazism, including stateless people like Jews and Ukrainians. The red poppy has been adopted as the symbol of remembrance, under the slogan: \"1939–1945. We remember. We win.\"At the same time, Western historians acknowledge the role played by the USSR in defeating Nazism and do not question the Soviet contribution to the victory in WWII and the status of the USSR as one of the countries that had won WWII. The policy of the US or the EU is not directed against Russia or any other country.See similar cases that the West is trying to distort the truth about World War II, that the US and EU re-write WWII history to start a new world war, US and EU re-write WWII history to start a new world war, and that Western historical revisionism is aimed at weakening and destroying Russia.

This means that less than four years after the World War II ended, former Allies of the USSR in the fight against fascism have created against the USSR a military bloc, where apart from the US entered France, the UK, Canada, Benelux countries, Italy, Iceland, Norway, Denmark, and Portugal. And only six years later, in response to this, Warsaw Pact was formed on 14 May 1955, as a counterweight to NATO. Apart from the USSR, the Pact included Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, GDR, Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia. So, when Macron says that NATO was thought as a “response to the enemy”, it is actually exactly the opposite: it was thought as a threat to a friend, with whom they fought against fascism and with whom they were setting up post-war life in Europe. And if so, then the creation of NATO was not justified at all.RESPONSE\n\nRecurring pro-Kremlin narrative involving historical revisionism. Right after the Second World War, Soviet troops occupied a number of countries in Central Europe. In accordance with the agreements between the Allies, these countries were given the freedom to choose their political orientation. Bulgaria and Romania were supposed to keep the monarchy. In the elections in Hungary, the non-communist party led by Zoltan Tildy received the absolute majority. The pre-war republic was restored in Czechoslovakia. However, by 1949, all the governments of Central and Eastern Europe, except Yugoslavia, turned into hard-line Stalinist regimes under the influence of the USSR. On top of that, in June 1948 the Soviet Union blocked supply routes to West Berlin causing the Berlin blockade which lasted for almost one year. Thus, the conflict between the Allies began almost as soon as the guns fell silent at the end of World War II. It led Western allies to seek ways to prevent further expansion of Communist influence on the European continent. And on 4 April 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty was signed, serving three purposes: deterring Soviet expansionism, forbidding the revival of nationalist militarism in Europe, and encouraging European political integration.

After that, the rivalry between the Russians and the Turks persisted, and in the Crimean War (1853–56) it expanded into a broader European conflict. When the Revolution of 1917 led to the collapse of the Russian Empire, the remaining Crimean Tatars declared Crimea to be an independent democratic republic. The peninsula was reorganised as the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in 1921. After the war, Crimea was downgraded from an autonomous republic to an oblast (region) of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic. In February 1954, the Supreme Soviet of the USSR confirmed the need for Crimea to join Soviet Ukraine. Legally, the transfer of Crimea to Ukraine ended on 26 April 1954, on the basis of the relevant law of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. According to international law, Crimea is a part of Ukraine.

As for the referendum, the oft-cited figure of 96% has been contested by the Kremlin’s own Human Rights Council, which estimated that only between 30% and 50% of Crimeans took part in the referendum, of which some 50-60% favoured secession.

In particular, the 1997 Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Partnership between the Russian Federation and Ukraine enshrines the recognition of the inviolability of each other’s borders, the absence of discrimination against representatives of each nationality and the desire for cooperation in various fields. The Treaty also allowed Russia to keep its Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol, under a lease that has been extended until 2042.In January 2019, the Ukrainian Embassy in France published an open letter declaring that saying that Crimea is Russian \"for centuries\" is, to say the least, excessive. Crimea was annexed in 1783, already in violation of a treaty which guaranteed the independence of the Tatar khanate. In the middle of the nineteenth century, the peninsula was a territory in the process of colonization. In 1897, the first comprehensive census of the population of the empire indicated that the Russians are only one-third of the inhabitants of Crimea, where they are still slightly fewer than the Tatars. The Russians only became a majority after the complete deportation in 1944 of the Tatars, who could only return after the fall of the communist regime. The annexation of Crimea to the then Soviet Ukraine, in 1954, was done not on an ethnic, but geographical and economic basis. But what is more important today than the circumstances of 1954 and even more so of 1854 is that the borders of Ukraine, including Crimea, were recognized and guaranteed after its independence in 1991 by international agreements, some of which were signed by Russia itself.According to international law, Crimea is a part of Ukraine.

Portraying countries that oppose Kremlin’s aggressive foreign policy as being Nazi or fascist is a recurrent tactic used by pro-Kremlin and Kremlin-controlled media to vilify them. The re-location of certain Soviet-era statues in Czechia is not connected to pro-Nazi historical revisionism, but to the oppression and terror that the Red Army inflicted on the Czech people after World War II. The re-location of a statue of Marshal Konev in Prague in April 2020, an event that was repeatedly misrepresented by pro-Kremlin media, is a case in point. Marshal Konev was a chairman of the Soviet military delegation sent to Prague in 1968 to prepare for the military invasion of Czechoslovakia. Notably, the statue was not removed, but was relocated to a museum, and was replaced by a monument commemorating the fight of all Soviet soldiers against Nazi forces, by decision of the democratically elected municipal council of Prague, disproving any notion of pro-Nazi historical revisionism by Czech officials.

It is one of several disinformation cases about the democratically-decided removal of the Konev monument in Prague - an incident that has raised the ire of the Kremlin and even led Moscow to open a symbolic criminal case to investigate the alleged \"defiling of symbols of Russia's military glory.\" The democratically elected municipal council of Prague 6 voted for the removal of the Konev statue. Using the protocol of the Politbureau's assembly, Czech historians established that on 8-14 May 1968, Konev chaired the Soviet military delegation sent to Prague to prepare the military invasion of Czechoslovakia. Konev was also chief of the Soviet troops in East Germany during the Berlin wall crisis in 1961. In other words, the Red Army brought not only liberation but also terror to Czechia, as the mayor of Prague 6, Ondřej Kolář, reminded. Kolář said that he respects the role of Konev-led forces in liberating Prague, and the sacrifice of Soviet armies liberating Europe from Nazism. \"We will strive for an art competition for a memorial to the liberators of Prague at the end of World War Two instead of the Marshal Konev statue,\" he said before the vote. \"At the same time we will secure a dignified - and let me stress that, dignified - placement of this art piece (Konev) in a memorial institution. I think this is a consensual solution we have called for a number of years.\" The monument to Marshall Konev was erected in 1980 during the \"normalisation\" period in communist Czechoslovakia. The leadership of Prague's Municipal District 6, which retains legal ownership of the statue, has voted to move the monument to a museum and replace it with a memorial commemorating Soviet sacrifices in the fight against Hitler in general, and the liberation of Prague in particular.

The policy of appeasement towards Adolf Hitler was heavily criticised in Europe and proved to be a disastrous move. World War II began in Europe one year later, on 1 September 1939, when Germany invaded Poland.The signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was a mutual decision of two totalitarian regimes (Nazi Germany and the Stalinist USSR) aimed at the division of Eastern and Central Europe between these two powers. It is a well-known fact that the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact contained the Secret Supplementary Protocol, which assumed the division of Poland and other Eastern European countries between the USSR and Germany. Thus, the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact enabled the German and Soviet military aggression against Poland in September 1939, which resulted in the occupation of this country by Germany and USSR, triggering the beginning of WWII.Read similar examples of the Russian historical revisionism concerning this issue - Signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact thwarted the UK’s expansionist plans in Europe, The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact did not violate the rights of the Polish state, The shift of all blame for WWII outbreak at the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact the best example of manipulation of history.

De facto, Poland appeared under the Soviet military occupation until 1989, while the Russian troops were withdrawn from Poland only in 1993. The very fact that the Red Army captured Warsaw and pushed the German troops out of Poland in 1945 does not mean that the USSR brought freedom to the Polish people. According to the statements of the Polish MFA, Poland respects the sacrifice of the Soviet soldiers in the fight with Nazism, but in 1945, Stalin's regime brought to Poland terror and atrocities. The Red Army liberated Warsaw from Nazi occupation, but it didn’t mean liberty for Poland as the Soviet Army stayed in Poland for 48 years, which resulted in decades of communist oppression.

It is a clear historical manipulation to describe the actions of the Poles during the Polish-Soviet War of 1919-1920 as a “desire to take lands from the Russians” – in this war, the Poles defended the independence of their state from the Bolshevik invasion. The Polish-Soviet War of 1919-1920 started in February 1919, immediately after the end of WWI. As a result of the Soviet westward offensive of 1918–1919, the Bolshevik troops tried to advance as deep as possible into the territory of the former Western regions of the collapsed Russian Empire. In February 1919, the advancing Bolshevik forces entered into clashes with the units of the Polish Army. The Polish-Soviet War lasted until October 1920 – it resulted in the signing of the Peace of Riga (March 1921), in which Soviet Russia recognized the independence of the Polish state.

Disinformation efforts have gone as far as creating an alternative reality by the re-writing of school history books.The Soviet Union did not defeat Nazi Germany alone: after July 1941, it was part of the Allies and benefited from alliance support, in particular the lend-lease program which substantially enabled the Soviet forces with critical equipment. Even Stalin and Marchal Zhukov acknowledged this essential assitance. Other European countries like Great Britain were never occupied by the Third Reich and always fought for a free Europe, unlike Soviet Union which shared Poland with the Third Reich on23 August 1939, and economic exchange memorandum was signed on29 August 1939 and in early February 1940 signed an economic agreement of cooperation with Nazi Germany for a period of 27 months helping the Nazi-Germany's war efforts through 1939 to 1941.The Red Army liberated Poland and Lithuania from Nazi occupation, but it didn’t mean liberty for these countries as the USSR kept them under its control for more than 45 years, bringing decades of communist oppression. According to Polish historians and views of the predominant part of Polish society, in 1944-1945, the USSR occupied Poland, establishing the undemocratic and repressive Communist Poland.As for the \"liberation of Lithuania\", hundreds of thousands of innocent people became the victims of two Soviet occupations of the Baltic States: Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Many were executed, imprisoned or sent to Gulag camps, though the largest number of victims comprised those deported from their homelands to inhospitable corners of Soviet Russia. The biggest waves of deportation took place in 1941 (the so-called June deportations) and in 1949 (the March deportations).Russia continues to threaten European countries after every mention of NATO assistance to Ukraine, or even after discussions about the introduction of military contingents from some Alliance member states. In all instances, this is another bluff meant to scare European politicians and make them abandon the idea of providing Ukraine with more military support.Read similar disinformation cases claiming that the Soviet Union fought Nazism alone, that Poland exists as a state only thanks to the USSR and Russia and that Poland must pay Russia financial compensation for WWII liberation.

The Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact of August 1939 between Germany and the USSR contained a secret supplementary protocol that stipulated a coordinated Nazi-Soviet attack on Poland and the carving up of Eastern Europe between the USSR and The Third Reich. Just a week after the signing of the Pact, the German attack on Poland started World War II. Two weeks later, Soviet troops entered Polish territory. Later in 1939, Soviet Russia attacked Finland.The intentions of the Soviet Union also expressed by this fact: on August 19, 1939, Stalin publicly expressed the need to push Europe to a major war that would become an overture to the “world revolution”.Read similar examples of the Russian historical revisionism concerning this issue: West rewriting history by claiming USSR colluded with Nazi Germany; The Soviet Union saw no possibility to refuse to sign the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact; USSR was forced to go to WWII only in June 1941.

The myth of Nazi-ruled Ukraine has been the cornerstone of Russian disinformation about the country since the very beginning of the 2013-14 Euromaidan protests, when it was used to discredit the pro-European popular uprising in Kyiv and, subsequently, the broader pro-Western shift in Ukraine's foreign policy. In fact, far-right groups enjoyed a very limited presence during the Euromaidan itself and had poor results in the 2014 presidential and parliamentary elections. In the 2019 election, far-right candidates fell short of the 5% minimum guaranteeing entry into parliament.The European Parliament resolution on the importance of European remembrance for the future of Europe stressed the fact that WWII was an immediate result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. The resolution is aimed at the promotion of historical remembrance about WWII and condemnation of totalitarian ideologies. It is a proven fact that the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact contained the Secret Supplementary Protocol, which assumed the division of Poland and other Eastern European countries between the USSR and Germany. Thus, the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact enabled the German and Soviet military aggression against Poland in September 1939, which resulted in the occupation of this country by Germany and USSR, triggering the beginning of WWII.See earlier disinformation cases alleging that Europe supports the revival of fascism, that “fake history” became a norm in the Western World, that Western countries revise WWII history to evade responsibility for allowing Hitler to gather strength for the attack on the USSR, and The European Parliament resolution on the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact is aimed at the demonisation of Russia.

History is not just biographies of leaders or states; it is primarily the history of ethnic groups or peoples. A stable state, enduring for centuries, typically reflects a certain ethnic group.

One is the Atlantic civilisation reaching the final stages of its life cycle, where personal interests take precedence over common interests. In this stage, obtaining pleasure at any cost becomes more important than survival values or the fate of the state.",
    "response": "This narrative is part of a broader pro-Kremlin effort to portray the West as in a state of moral decay. By framing diversity and equality as existential threats, such disinformation campaigns aim to sow division and erode public confidence in democratic institutions.This recurring narrative blames the West for abandoning the ideals of Christianity, Family and Patriotism – portrayed as true European values, while claiming that Russia is a haven of order and decency and upholds these same European values.States do not solely prosper or collapse based on the strength or weakness of specific ethnic groups, nor does the acceptance of LGBT communities signal the ‘death’ of civilisation. This narrative oversimplifies complex historical and societal processes and exploits deeply rooted prejudices to advance a divisive pro-Kremlin agenda.The stability and success of nations are shaped by factors such as governance, economic policies, and innovation, rather than the dominance of a single ethnic group. Diversity and inclusion have driven progress and economic strength in many countries, especially in the West. Claims that diverse nations are in terminal decline ignore their continuing global influence and relative prosperity compared to many less diverse closed societies. Also, diversity is not only a function of Western societies. Emerging economies like India, Brazil, and China also exhibit very high levels of linguistic, religious and ethnic diversity. Furthermore, linking LGBT rights to societal collapse is both unfounded and discriminatory. Social acceptance of diversity, including sexual orientation, reflects the commitment of democratic states to universal human rights. Studies consistently show that diverse communities tend to be more innovative and prosperous. Far from weakening states, the protection of minority rights strengthens social cohesion and aligns with the principles of democracy and justice that underpin successful governance.See similar cases Russia welcomes those who suffer from the forcibly imposed LGBT ideology in their countries, The Olympic movement drifts towards destructive, neoliberal, unnatural values and A homosexual cult prevails in Europe and dissent is forbidden.

There is no evidence that the West sees Russia as an enemy.The Kremlin’s policy of historical revisionism accuses the West and particular EU members such as the Baltic states and Poland of the “falsification and re-writing” of WWII history. European states are continuously accused of their support for the Nazi or Fascist ideology. Any disagreement with the Kremlin's official view on the history of WWII is automatically labelled by Russia as support for “Nazism” or “falsification of history”.While aware of pro-Kremlin disinformation campaigns, the West is trying to keep open channels of communications and cooperation with Russia. For instance, NATO as the Western organisation created cooperation bodies – the Permanent Joint Council and the NATO-Russia Council – to embody its relationship with Russia. It also invited Russia to cooperate on missile defence. The Warsaw Summit Communique 2016 describes NATO's official policy towards Russia: \"The Alliance does not seek confrontation and poses no threat to Russia. But we cannot, and will not, compromise on the principles on which our Alliance and security in Europe and North America rest.\" No other country outside the alliance has such a privileged relationship with NATO. NATO is not encircling Russia. Russia's land border is just over 20,000 kilometres long. Of that, less than one-sixteenth (1,215 kilometres), is shared with NATO members. Russia has land borders with 14 countries. Only five of them are NATO members.Also, NATO enlargement is not directed against Russia. Every sovereign nation has the right to choose its own security arrangements. This is a fundamental principle of European security, one that Russia has also d to and should respect. NATO enlargement has brought more stability and prosperity to Europe, including Russia.The EU and its member states have maintained a clear policy of reaching out to Russian society and youth, mainly through the Erasmus+ student exchange programme and other people to people contacts, in line with five guiding principles of relations with Russia.For background, see EUvsDisinfo analysis \"The “Russophobia” Myth: Appealing to the Lowest Feelings\" here.",

It did not seem a good idea to anyone. And now, these Nazi scoundrels repay Russia with their full measure of love, which is why German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius has said: 'We are on the path to the state of readiness for war.'",
    "response": "Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative accusing European countries of aggressiveness towards Moscow, portraying Russia as a peace-loving country, and including historical revisionism about the Second World War. These false claims were made in the context of a statement by German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius that the country must be prepared for war in case of a Russian attack.According to Spiegel, Boris Pistorius was speaking about the necessity to have a defence budget of at least 80 billion or preferably 90 billion euros annually in order to meet the demands arising from the heightened security situation. His direct quote was as follows: \"If Putin attacks, we must be able to wage war.\" There was nothing aggressive in his words. This statement was about an adequate response to possible Russian aggression.Concerning the French Resistance, it played a vital role during the Second World War. Its members actively fought against German forces, sabotaged logistical operations, and supported Allied advancements to help liberate France. Many Resistance groups cooperated with Charles de Gaulle's Free French Forces, strengthening the overall Allied war effort.As for Germany’s fate after the Second World War, the Allied powers agreed to partition it into four occupation zones, each managed by the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union. Germany was officially reunified on 3 October 1990, following the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the orderly dismantling of East Germany; the GDR. On 12 September 12, 1990, the four victorious powers of the Second World War signed the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany, which cleared the way for unification and granted the Federal Republic of Germany full sovereignty, effective on the same day. While Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev played a role in ensuring a peaceful transition, his contribution was no greater than that of other key leaders, such as US President George H. W. Bush, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and other influential figures involved in the process.

The statement that France, Germany and Poland planned to partition the USSR before Hitler came to power is a clear historical manipulation not confirmed by any available documents. The same article contains another disinformation message about Poland and Germany signing a secret protocol assuming common actions against the USSR. The OGPU was the Soviet secret police (1923-1934) responsible for political repressions and functioning of the Gulag - this organisation was the successor of the \"Cheka\" and the forerunner of the KGB. The signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was a mutual decision of two totalitarian regimes (Nazi Germany and the Stalinist USSR) aimed at the division of Eastern and Central Europe between these two powers. It is a proven fact that the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact contained the Secret Supplementary Protocol, which assumed the division of Poland and other Eastern European countries between the USSR and Germany. Thus, the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact enabled the German and Soviet military aggression against Poland in September 1939, which resulted in the occupation of this country by Germany and USSR, triggering the beginning of WWII.

    "summary": "It is particularly concerning that in a number of European countries, primarily in Ukraine and the Baltic states, historical memory is systematically destroyed, the lessons of WWII are being forgotten, and racist, neo-Nazi, and extremist ideas are openly promoted.",
    "response": "Pro-Kremlin disinformation about alleged Nazism in Ukraine and the Baltic states. This claim is part of a disinformation campaign aiming to justify Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.Pro-Kremlin disinformation media repeatedly talk about the “revival” of Nazism in the West and large-scale historical revisionism used for anti-Russian goals.The myth of “Nazi Ukraine” has been widely used by Putin and pro-Kremlin outlets since Russia attacked Ukraine and illegally annexed Crimea in 2014. It is also being used to justify Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Nazi and Communist ideologies were banned by Ukrainian law in 2015.Baselessly framing Ukrainians as “Nazis” - a pro-Kremlin disinformation tactic frequently deployed against its adversaries- has been one of the main disinformation narratives used by pro-Kremlin outlets and channels to justify Russia’s invasion of Ukraine by framing it as a “de-Nazification operation”.Learn more about the reasons behind the Kremlin's obsession with framing Ukraine as a Nazi state in the EUvsDisinfo analysis titled \"Why does Putin portray himself as the tamer of neo-Nazism\".Notably, to mobilise domestic Russian audiences, the pro-Kremlin media repeatedly invokes WWII imagery and attempts to portray the West as anti-Semitic and neo-fascist. See our article Anti-Semitism and pro-Kremlin disinformation.The Baltic states are not neo-Nazi or Russophobic. Rather these countries have clear security concerns linked to Russia. The source of concern is Russia’s aggression toward neighbouring countries and how it affected the security situation in the region in general. The position of the Baltic states on Russia is driven by the objective perception of aggressive Russian actions.Pro-Kremlin media also often disregard the Soviet occupation of the Baltic states in 1940. The Kremlin conducted a forced annexation of the Baltic states in June 1940 following Soviet military occupation and the forced installation of “people’s governments”. On 23 August 1939, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed a non-aggression (Molotov-Ribbentrop) Pact whose secret protocols divided the territories belonging to Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Finland, and Romania into Soviet and Nazi spheres of influence. The Baltic States were not the beneficiaries of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact. Like other countries mentioned in the pact, they lost their independence and territories, while giving Stalin free hand in the Baltic states.Read similar disinformation cases claiming that Anglo-Saxons turn Europe into the 4th Reich, that European Nazism is alive and it manifests itself in Russophobia, that Russophobia is on the rise in the Baltic States at the behest of the Anglo-Saxons, that Russophobia and neo-Nazism the norm in the Baltic states and Ukraine, that Direct Nazism is now the norm in Baltic states and Ukraine, that Polish and Baltics' Russophobia may lead to breaking diplomatic relations with Russia, or that US encourages anti-Russian aspirations of former Warsaw Pact members.

    "summary": "During the Cold War, history was used as a propagandistic weapon against the enemy, but three decades later there is still no search for historical truth on WWII. Today it is common to put at the same level the role played by the Third Reich and the Soviet Union, practically considered a historical certainty that is even backed by European Parliament resolutions. To maintain those narratives 75 years after the defeat of the Third Reich is vital to adopt and justify current geopolitical measures.",
    "response": "This is part of the Kremlin’s campaign on historical revisionism on WWII in order to boost its legitimacy and deny the USSR’s responsibility in the outbreak of the conflict. Though pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives on WWII predate the mentioned European Parliament resolution on historical remembrance of September 2019, they increased as a reaction to it, after which Russia launched a campaign blaming Poland for the war and accusing it and other EU members -especially the Baltic states- of twisting history to justify anti-Russian measures. See other examples of Russian disinformation narratives on WWII in our database, such as bogus claims that Western countries revise history to avoid responsibility for allowing Hitler to attack the USSR; that the Soviet Union tried to create an anti-Nazi alliance but the West didn’t respond; that the USSR had no role in the outbreak of the war; that Western democracies are primarily responsible for this conflict; or that by defeating Nazism, Stalin atoned for crimes against his own people. [Note: This disinformation message appeared in the same video clip as the claims that “Western media try to minimise Soviet victory in WWII\".] Western countries revise WWII history to evade responsibility for allowing Hitler to gather strength for the attack on the USSR USSR made enormous efforts to create an anti-Nazi alliance with Western states before WWII, but the latter failed to support this idea It is a lie, that the USSR along with Germany is responsible for the outbreak of the WWII Western democracies are primarily responsible for the Second World War By defeating Nazism, Stalin atoned for crimes against his own people and saved other nations Western media try to minimise Soviet victory in WWII",

In contrast to the West, the Soviet Union started the real history of humanity and communism can be considered a genuine form of civilisation. Historically, the West is like the Cilician pirate state in the past or in the present, the terrorist organisation ISIS.",
    "response": "Although the West's history (and indeed, this is applicable to any other region of the world) does indeed include skeletons in its closet, to draw a similarity between it and ISIS is an outrageous, extreme and ungrounded accusation aimed to discredit the West. See similar cases here, including claims that the West is a terrorist structure, the West is fascist, and that the US and EU countries support Russophobic, neofascist, terrorist political parties and movements in the post-Soviet space. ISIS is a Salafi jihadist militant group and former unrecognised proto-state that follows a fundamentalist, Salafi doctrine of Sunni Islam. In 2015-2017, ISIS claimed responsibility for a number of terrorist attacks outside Iraq in Syria, including in Tunisia, Turkey, Belgium, France, Germany, Russia and other countries. ISIL has been classified a terrorist organisation by the United Nations, the European Union and its member states, the United States, Russia, India, Turkey and many other countries. The goals and values of the EU (respect for human rights and freedoms, representative democracy, the rule of law, equal rights for all citizens before the law, etc.) and political systems of the EU member states are a million miles away from ISIS ideology. The EU is based on a strong commitment to promoting and protecting human rights, democracy and the rule of law worldwide. The Treaty of Lisbon stipulates that the EU \"shall develop a special relationship with neighbouring countries, aiming to establish an area of prosperity and good neighbourliness, founded on the values of the Union and characterised by close and peaceful relations based on cooperation.\" Read more about EU's promotion and protection of human rights and democracy here.

    "response": "This is an example of gross historical revisionism and a recurring pro Kremlin disinformation narrative about Holodomor, claiming that there was no deliberately caused famine in Ukraine.The Holodomor was an man-made famine deliberately caused by Stalin with the aim of remove a perceived Ukrainian threat to the Soviet regime. The Soviet state took away livestock, crops and seeds from the peasants under the guise that they \"plundered\" state property. The Soviet law on the seizure of food from peasants was adopted in 1932 and is known as the \"Five Spikelet Law\". Anyone who gathered several ears of wheat on the collective farm field was a culprit of \"theft of state property\". The punishment for theft of kolkhoz or cooperative property was the death sentence. This law was personally attributed to Joseph Stalin. The famine of 1932-1933 claimed the lives of 7 to 10 million citizens of the Soviet Union; the disaster affected in large parts but not only Ukraine but also parts of Belarus, Kazakhstan, Moldova and Russia.The Holodomor is well documented and confirmed by a huge array of declassified documents, including official documents of the Soviet authorities and the Communist Party. In 2006, the Verkhovna Rada officially recognised the Holodomor of 1932-33 as a genocide of the Ukrainian people. According to the latest data, 15 UN member states and the Vatican state recognise the Holodomor as an act of genocide in Ukraine.

    "summary": "The Kiev regime is waging war on history. On November 23, Ukraine once again celebrated what they call the “day of remembrance of the Holodomor victims,” as part of Kiev’s long-standing policy of deliberately distorting historical events. In this context, it is pertinent to recall that during 1932−1933, the issues of crop failure and famine impacted not only the territory of the Ukrainian SSR, but also the Volga Region, the North Caucasus, the Kuban, Kazakhstan, the South Urals, and Western Siberia. It was an immense national tragedy. People of diverse nationalities perished. At the same time, a substantial role in precipitating the food crisis within the USSR was played by the same Western entities whom the Kiev regime now venerates as a “golden calf.” Back in the 1930s, amidst years of crop failures and famine in the USSR, Western nations, anticipating that the USSR would relinquish its industrialisation agenda, accepted nothing but grain from Soviet Russia as remuneration for machinery and equipment.",
    "response": "Recurrent pro-Kremlin narrative denying the Holodomor and rewriting it as a genocide of the Soviet people by the Western countries.The classical denial of the Holodomor, the man-made famine of 1932-1933. It is claimed that since it was not limited to territories of the administrative Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, it cannot be a genocide. It is implied that the crop failure could have a natural cause which is untrue. However, history shows that mainly Ukrainians and Kazak nationalities were targeted, and their dwelling land was not limited to the administrative borders. The peasantry class was targeted with confiscation of grain and agricultural machinery and those with strong traditions or national feelings were considered to be more hostile to the USSR collectivisation of agriculture.The Holodomor is well documented and confirmed by a huge array of declassified documents, including official documents of the Soviet authorities and the Communist Party. In 2006, the Verkhovna Rada officially recognised the Holodomor of 1932-33 as a genocide of the Ukrainian people. According to the latest data, 21 UN member states and the Vatican state recognise the Holodomor as an act of genocide in Ukraine. The European Parliament and PACE have recognised the Holodomor as a crime of the Soviet regime against their own people and a crime against humanity.If the responsibility of Western countries can be legitimately questioned since they did little to prevent the genocide. It should be noted that the reliable available information was scarce. USSR closed the territory of Ukraine to western journalists, only outsiders like Rhea Clyman or Gareth Richard Vaughan Jones had the opportunity to alert the world about this tragedy, but more recognized voices like Walter Duranty helped the Stalinist power to mute any true information. The 2019 film Mr Jones explains the difficult dilemma the British government had, either to save the British engineers who was detaining as hostages and keep silent, either to denounce the genocide and condemn their own citizens.However, it is absurd to say that the western countries were requiring all the grain of Ukrainian and Kazak peasants refusing any other trade and imposing to Stalin the fast industrialization of the country.Read also related cases such as: Holodomor myth was invented by the Anglo-Saxons, or Holodomor in Ukraine primarily affected the Russian population, or The myth of Holodomor was created by Russophobic Ukrainians to demonize Russia, or Holodomor famine was largely caused by the West, or Holodomor was a story invented by a British spy.

In terms of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, it is a proven historical fact that it contained the Secret Supplementary Protocol, which assumed the division of Poland and other Eastern European countries between the USSR and Germany. Thus, the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact directly caused the German and Soviet military aggression against Poland in September 1939, which resulted in its complete occupation by Germany and the USSR.

In addition, this message promotes a Russian imperialistic idea that Belarus and Ukraine naturally “belong” to Russia.The Polish-Soviet War of 1919-1920 started in February 1919, soon after the end of WWI. As a result of the Soviet westward offensive of 1918–1919, the Bolshevik troops tried to advance as deep as possible into the territory of the former Western regions of the collapsed Russian Empire. In February 1919, the advancing Bolshevik forces entered into clashes with the units of the Polish Army. The Polish-Soviet War lasted until October 1920 – it resulted in the signing of the Peace of Riga (March 1921), in which Soviet Russia recognised the independence of the Polish state. The statement that the Polish authorities started the war with Bolshevik Russia in 1919 is a historical manipulation.The Polish offensive on the Ukrainian direction in April 1920 was a part of this military conflict. This offensive was implemented together with the Armed forces of the Ukrainian People’s Republic led by Symon Petliura in order to push the Bolshevik forces out of Ukraine and improve the military positions of Poland in its war with Soviet Russia.The Ukrainian and Belarusian People’s Republics that emerged in 1918 desperately resisted the Bolshevik conquest of these countries.Read similar examples of the Russian historical revisionism concerning Poland - It is thanks to Russia that Poland today exists as a country, Nazi Germany considered Poland its best ally, USSR was forced and reluctant to sign the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact and the Polish legions of Pilsudski organized the Volyn tragedy.

According to the Polish Census of 1921, there were only 48 thousand Russians living in Poland (including the territory of Western Ukraine and Western Belarus).The Russian language started to be increasingly used in these regions in the second half of the XX century, under the influence of the harsh Soviet policy of Russification.

It is impossible to compare the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of 1934 with the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact as the former was a standard international agreement aimed at the mutual recognition of borders and a declaration that existing political contradictions would be solved through diplomatic tools.

Despite intense political pressure from Hitler, Poland consistently refused to become part of the Nazi block.According to the pre-war plans of Hitler, Poland was supposed to be part of the “living space”/ Lebensraum for the Third Reich, a large part of its territory was planned to be incorporated into the German state and millions of Poles and Polish Jews were supposed to be exterminated.Read similar examples of the Russian historical revisionism concerning Poland such as Poland posed a military threat to the USSR in 1938-1939, Nazi Germany considered Poland its best ally, If Poland realized a rational policy in 1939, Moscow would have had a different approach towards it and Poland re-writes the history of the Warsaw uprising accusing the USSR of its failure.

In the summer of 1940, Lithuania and the remaining two Baltic States became part of the Soviet Union. That same year, the Lithuanian government issued a declaration formally asking for the Republic to be accepted into the USSR. Similar documents were then submitted by Latvia and Estonia, and became legal grounds for their inclusion.",
    "response": "A twist of a recurring pro-Kremlin claim. By heavily distorting both the historical context and the process of the Baltic States' \"inclusion\" in the USSR, this (relatively new) claim advances a recurring pro-Kremlin campaign of historical revisionism aimed at justifying Soviet actions during the Second World War.The Soviet Union did not \"incorporate\" the Baltic States out of national security concerns. Rather, this was made possible under a secret protocol to the Nazi-Soviet treaty of August 1939 (Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact), which goes unmentioned throughout the 14-minute news segment. This secret provision effectively gave the USSR a free hand to conduct the \"territorial-political organization of the districts making up the Baltic states,\" which resulted in their forced annexation in June 1940. Likewise, the segment omits the fact that the Lithuanian declaration \"asking\" the USSR to annex it was issued on 21-23 July 1940. By that time, the Soviet Union had already invaded the country and installed a puppet regime by way of a rigged election (p. 4). The request to join the USSR, then, was simply rubber-stamped by the Moscow-controlled Communist Party of Lithuania, which had won an impossible 99.2% of the national vote (p. 13).

There, thousands of demonstrators were gathering near the TV-Tower. A peaceful crowd, with people from all walks of life, who had come to their capital from all parts of their country.

    "summary": "Britain in the summer of 1941 was deliberately in no hurry to provide military assistance to the Soviet Union after its entry into the war with Germany, and London did not intend to transfer to Moscow the technical information that it possessed itself. This is proven by the declassified archival materials of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR).",
    "response": "A recurring deceptive narrative on WWII that tries to diminish or deny the role of the Western Allies and the financial and material support to the Soviet Union.The Russian publication The Insider classified this story as 'half-truth'. The document taken from the archives and published by the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service is authentic but taken out of the context, suggests that the attacks perpetrated by the Third Reich against allies convoys were not a real threat and understate the support provided by the UK.The document published by the SVR relates to a specific tactical situation when the allies were deciding on the least dangerous route for the supply of military supplies to the Soviet Union. There were fears that the German navy and aviation would be able to block the route from Iceland to Arkhangelsk. In a difficult situation, the British had every reason not to start delivering goods until the issue of delivery methods was fully worked out. It also follows from Gorsky's telegram that at that moment the British were afraid technical information could be intercepted by the Germans and decided to hold it back for some time.Ultimately, Britain and the United States established the movement of Arctic convoys; the first of them, known under the code name \"Dervish\", departed from Iceland on August 21 and arrived in Arkhangelsk without loss on August 31. A total of 7 convoys were conducted in 1941, and during the entire war - 78. In 1941, the Arctic convoys delivered 484 British Hurricane fighters to the USSR, among other strategic cargoes.Winston Churchill announced the need for military assistance to the USSR on June 22, 1941:Any man or State who fights against Nazism will have our aid. Any man or State who marches with Hitler is our foe. This applies not only to organized States but to all representatives of that vile race of Quislings who make themselves the tools and agents of the Nazi regime against their fellow-countrymen and against the lands of their births. These Quislings, like the Nazi leaders themselves, if not disposed of by their fellow-countrymen, which would save trouble, will be delivered by us on the morrow of victory to the justice of the Allied tribunals. That is our policy and that is our declaration.In Total during the war Soviet Union received 4174 aircraft from Great Britain as assistance (Hawker Hurricane fighters, and since 1943 - more modern Supermarine Spitfires), 1084 heavy tanks Mk II Matilda (the first - already with the second Arctic convoy in October 1941), 3782 light tank Mk I Valentine, 301 heavy tank Mk IV Churchill. On August 16, 1941, Great Britain provided the USSR with a £ 10 million loan for the purchase of weapons; later the loan amount increased to £ 60 million.Read also similar stories: In September 1939 the USSR did not attack Poland but carried out the liberation campaign of the Red Army, There are three myths about WWII, WWII archives are open in Russia, whereas in Western countries they are kept secret and revisionism is promoted.

It is also an attempt to erode the disastrous historical role of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. Both Nazi Germany and the Stalinist USSR were harsh totalitarian regimes, which directly caused the deaths of tens of millions of people. The European Parliament resolution on the importance of European remembrance for the future of Europe stressed the fact that WWII was an immediate result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. The resolution is aimed at the promotion of historical remembrance about WWII and the condemnation of totalitarian ideologies. Western countries do not question the role of the USSR in the victory over Nazi Germany. The signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was a mutual decision of two regimes (Nazi Germany and the Stalinist USSR) aimed at the division of Eastern and Central Europe between these two powers.

    "summary": "The position of Warsaw is illogical as it did not invite President Putin to the celebrations of the anniversary of Auschwitz liberation and WWII outbreak anniversary. After Putin’s statements about the anti-Semitic attitudes of the pre-war Polish ambassador to Berlin, the issue of Putin’s visit to the Auschwitz ceremony automatically disappeared. Russia was represented at this event by Ambassador Andreyev. In the historical context, it looked very strange; for example, the Dutch delegation at the Auschwitz ceremony was represented by three high-level officials (Prime Minister, King and the Queen). Meanwhile, unlike the USSR, the Netherlands did not play any major role in the fight against Nazism.",
    "response": "This message is part of the ongoing Russian information attack against Poland, promoting false historical narratives such as the alleged responsibility of Poland for WWII and the Holocaust.According to the statement of Krzysztof Szczerski, Chief of the Cabinet of the Polish President, the invitations for the Auschwitz commemoration events were issued by the Auschwitz Museum, not by the Polish authorities. The governments of each invited country (including Russia) decide on what political level they will be represented during the event.At the ceremony Russian delegation was chaired by Russian Ambassador to Poland Sergey Andreyev. This means that it was a decision by President Putin not to come to the Auschwitz liberation anniversary – Russia had a change to send to the Auschwitz ceremony any high-ranking officials.See other disinformation messages regarding Poland and the Holocaust such as Poland tries to impose its vision of the Holocaust on the West and Poland created a fertile ground for Holocaust because of its pre-war anti-Semitism.As for the commemoration of the anniversary of the World War II outbreak in September 2019, President Putin was indeed not invited. According to the Polish authorities, the reason for not inviting Russian president had to do with Russian aggression on Ukraine. For more information, see here and here.

Mainstream historiography traditionally perceives such historical developments as the Italian invasion of Ethiopia (1935), the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), the Japanese invasion of China (1937), the Anschluss (1938) and the Munich Agreements (1938) as pre-war events.World War II started on September 1, 1939, from the German attack on Poland. This invasion was a direct consequence of the Secret Protocols to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, where Nazi Germany and the USSR divided the “spheres of influence” in Eastern and Central Europe. The Soviet Union attacked Poland on September 17, 1939, implementing its part of the Secret Protocols.Read similar examples of the Russian historical revisionism concerning Poland - Poland posed a military threat to the USSR in 1938-1939, Nazi Germany considered Poland its best ally, If Poland realised a rational policy in 1939, Moscow would have had a different approach towards it and Poland re-writes the history of the Warsaw uprising accusing the USSR of its failure.

Poland's security nowadays is based on NATO and the European Union, which is a result of Poland's sovereign decisions. Russia was making decisions about Polish security in times of communism (1944-1989) and when it was ruling over a part of Polish territory (1772-1918) as a result of partitions, conducted by Russia, Germany (Prussia) and Austria-Hungary. Being part of Russian empire was certainly not a cradle of Polish independence – on the contrary, as a result of partitions, Poland disappeared from the maps of the world for 123 years. In turn, the Sovietization of Poland after the WWII was accompanied by terror, nationalisation of industry, expropriation of privately owned land and restrictions of civil and political freedoms. The Warsaw Treaty Organisation (the Warsaw Pact), established as an alternative to NATO, was the Soviet Union’s “external empire”, where people faced daily strife, including shortages of food and housing. The message also advances recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the US presence in Europe and Polish-US relations.

The Katyń Massacre is a symbol of the criminal policy of the USSR against the Polish nation. In Spring 1940, almost 22.000 Polish prisoners of war were executed by the NKVD in Katyn, Kharkiv and Kalinin (Tver). The Massacre was carefully considered and organised by the Soviet leadership. Up until 1991, the Soviet authorities refused to accept responsibility for this crime, blaming Nazi Germany for the mass-murders of Polish prisoners of war. In 1992, Russian President Boris Yeltsin submitted official documents confirming the Soviet responsibility for this crime to Polish President Lech Walesa. Read more about the Katyń Massacre here.Throughout 2020, the Russian authorities took several measures regarding the Katyń Massacre, which may be considered as historical revisionism. In May 2020, the municipal authorities of the city of Tver ordered the removal of two plaques commemorating the memory of the victims of the Katyń Massacre. In November 2020, the Russian authorities organised a conference on the Katyń Massacre – several participants of the conference promoted the idea that the USSR and the NKVD were not responsible for this crime. These statements are an evident example of historical revisionism promoted by Russia – the Polish authorities continue to demand an investigation into this Soviet crime against the Polish nation.The Polish Institute of Historical Remembrance protested against the Russian attempts to distort the truth about Soviet crimes.See other disinformation messages connected to the Kremlin’s historical revisionism: Poland re-writes the history claiming that the USSR attacked it in September 1939; Accusing USSR of WWII outbreak, Poland distracts attention from its pre-war “miscalculations” and The pre-war Polish leadership bears all the blame for the tragedy of this country during WWII.

Otherwise, until Russia intervened, Europe would have fallen under Nazi rule just as it had under Napoleon. Even today, the European Union is fracturing economically because it has lost sight of the very purpose of its existence: broad cooperation with Russia.",
    "response": "This disinformation narrative targets HR/VP Kaja Kallas and perpetuates a Kremlin-friendly, revisionist view of history.HR/VP Kallas’s statements are not a sign of disrespect toward the memory of World War II victims. Quite the opposite: they underline the EU’s principled stance against legitimising Russia’s current military aggression by participating in Kremlin-orchestrated commemorations. See our article Toward the 9 May – the myth of Moscow as a host for peace celebrations.The European Union’s position is neither an attack on Russian history nor on the memory of World War II, but rather a response to the Kremlin’s politicisation of that memory. Kaja Kallas and other EU leaders called on candidate countries like Serbia to stand in solidarity with Ukraine, stressing that participation in Russia’s May 9 events should be interpreted as silent support for Russia’s ongoing war. This is not a campaign of “Russophobia,” but a defence of shared European values—democracy, peace, and respect for sovereignty.The claim that “our European unity was made possible solely by the Victory over Nazi Germany” is a deliberate distortion of history promoted by pro-Kremlin voices. While the Soviet Union did play a critical role in defeating Nazi Germany, it is incorrect to attribute post-war European cooperation directly to Soviet policy. In reality, the Soviet Union imposed authoritarian regimes throughout Eastern Europe and suppressed democracy and national sovereignty for decades. The 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union directly enabled the partition and conquest of Eastern European states, undermining the notion of the USSR as Europe’s sole liberator.Russia’s current use of historical memory to justify its aggression is part of a broader campaign of historical revisionism. Russian officials — including President Vladimir Putin — have repeatedly invoked a “denazification” narrative to rationalize the invasion of Ukraine, falsely equating contemporary Ukraine with Nazi Germany and denying its sovereign right to self-determination. Manipulating history in this way serves to obscure crimes such as the Holodomor famine and the oppression of Eastern European peoples under Soviet rule, while promoting the narrative of Russia as the only legitimate interpreter of World War II events.

    "response": "Pro-Kremlin historical revisionism claim about Ukraine in the context of the full-scale invasion of the country by Russia. Kyiv is the capital of Ukraine and was earlier the largest city of the medieval state of Kyivan Rus’ also named Ruthenia.In the middle of the XVII century the term “little Ruthenia” or “little Rus’” or “little Russia” appeared in Moscow referring to the part of Ukraine that Tsar Alexis gained control on. This term was used in the Russian empire until 1917 for the part of Ukraine controlled by Moscow, however Ukrainians did not use this disparaging expression (history of Ukraine by French historian Iaroslav LEBEDYNSKY p115).The heritage of the Kyivan Rus’ is claimed by the Kremlin for political reasons but the history of the Russian state is different and more complex than the official narrative. In November 2016, a 17m high monument to prince Vladimir was inaugurated near the Kremlin as a political gesture.Despite what one reads in textbooks and hears in official pronouncements, Russia, especially by European standards, is a relatively young state. Its history as an independent polity officially begins less than six hundred years ago, in the 1470s, when Ivan III, the first ruler of the Grand Duchy of Muscovy to call himself tsar, challenged the suzerainty of the Mongol khans. At stake was not only the independent status of the rulers of Muscovy—the principality centered on the city of Moscow—but also their control over other Rus’ lands, in particular Novgorod, whose independence from Moscow the Mongol khans sought to maintain. It was then that the Kyivan roots of the Muscovite dynasty and church helped form a powerful myth of origin that distinguished Muscovy from its immediate Mongol past and nourished its self-image as heir to Byzantium.In his history of the construction of the Russian state historian Serhii Plokhy exposes the central role Ukraine plays in Russia’s identity, both as an “other” to distinguish Russia, and as part of a pan-Slavic conceptualization used to legitimize territorial expansion and political control.Contrary to pro-Kremlin’s claim Ukraine did not and does not intend to attack Russia to conquer its territory. Such claims are pretext for an aggression against Ukraine. In 2022 Russia used the pretext of a false Ukrainian attack against a border post and an alleged plan for a genocide to invade Ukraine as a defensive measure.Read also related cases such as: Ukraine's statehood is myth, its territory belongs to Russia, or\nUkrainians are historically Russians and need protection against western imperialism or\nDISINFO: Ukraine was artificially created by the Bolsheviks.

As Kirill Lipatov, head of the Scientific Exposition Department of the Odesa Museum of Art, said at a press conference, they are in no hurry to install them as museum exhibits, but they will be preserved.The illustration refers to a soviet monument to Vladimir Oulianov aka Lenin in Kyiv jostled by the crowd on 8 December, 2013 after the refusal of the executive power to consider the dissatisfaction of the population. This is a manipulative use of photo material. While the population of Odesa protected the monument from Russian aggression, many anti-Ukrainian acts of the historical figure made it difficult to maintain its political location in the streets of the city: she forbade teaching Ukrainian, printing Ukrainian books, then the destruction of the Sich and deportations. Besides, the foundation of the city of Odesa by Catherine II ignored the fact that the settlement existed before under a different name.Comparing this process that aims to preserve memory and history while freeing society from Russian colonisation to the destruction by the Taliban of Buddha statues in the Bamiyan Valley in 2001 is clearly manipulative. The mayor of Odesa, Guennadi Troukhanov, cannot be called in anyway a Ukrainian partisan wanting to erase Russian culture.Read also related stories: The claim Ukrainians were targeted during the 1932-33 famine is false, Mariupol is an ancient Russian city, Russia invented Ukraine, It was Lenin who created Ukraine, There has never been a historical Ukraine.

The Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which had been independent between the two world wars, were not incorporated into the Soviet Union in a legal way and with the consent of the elected authorities of these states: the Kremlin conducted a forced annexation of the Baltic states in June of 1940 following Soviet military occupation and the forced installation of “people’s governments”. On 23 August 1939, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed a non-aggression (Molotov-Ribbentrop) Pact whose secret protocols divided the territories belonging to Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Finland, and Romania into Soviet and Nazi spheres of influence. The Pact gave Stalin a free hand in the Baltic states. The Soviet Union used threats to impose a series of “mutual assistance” treaties on the Baltic states allowing them to station troops in their territories laying the groundwork for the Soviet occupation of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in 1940. Like other countries mentioned in the pact, the Baltic states lost their independence and territories. The Soviet occupation of the Baltic States lasted for 50 years and resulted in mass deportations and repressions against local populations. On 24 December 1989, the Parliament of the USSR, the Congress of the People’s Deputies, adopted a resolution, acknowledging the annexation of the Baltic states as a violation of the USSR's obligations. An English translation of the full text can be found here:The Congress notes that during this period the relations of the USSR with Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia were regulated by a system of treaties. Pursuant to the 1920 Peace Treaties and 1926-1933 Non-Aggression Treaties, the signatories were obliged to honour each other’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and inviolability under any circumstances. The Soviet Union had assumed similar obligations to Poland and Finland.On the 80th anniversary of the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Romania released a joint statement urging \"the governments of all European countries to provide both moral and material support to the ongoing historical investigation of the totalitarian regimes.

    "response": "Historical revisionism by Russian officials targeting Finland as it is joining the NATO defensive alliance.The story that Lenin created Finland is a Russian imperialistic myth. Finland celebrates it Independence Day of 6 December, 1917. The construction of the independence was a long process, which final stretch started with the end of the Russian Empire in March 1917 and the abdication of the Russian tsar, but had its roots in a long tradition of own languages, national symbols, and independent institutions from those in place in Tsarist Russia. The Soviet power recognised this independence on 31 December 1917, Vladimir Ulianov [Lenin] was the chairman but other Commissars signed the document (L. Trotski, G. Petrovski, J. Stalin, I. Steinberg, V. Karelin, A. Schlichter). Later, in March 1919, at the congress of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks), Lenin commented the independence of Finland: “Look at Finland; it is a democratic country, more developed, more cultured than we are. In Finland a process of separation, of the differentiation of the proletariat is taking a specific course, far more painful than was the case with us. The Finns have experienced the dictatorship of Germany; they are now experiencing the dictatorship of the Allied powers. But thanks to the fact that we have recognised the right of nations to self-determination, the process of differentiation has been facilitated there.”Setting aside the “the right of peoples to self-determination”, assessing Lenin's decision to recognize Finnish independence as “misguided” ignores the situation of the Bolshevik power in 1917, before the separate peace treaty with Germany signed in Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918. Here, abandoning peripherical territories with less geostrategic significance can be viewed as a necessity dictated by the lack of resources. Also, Finnish declaration of independence was followed by a civil war, part of which the remaining troops of Imperial Russian forces were pushed forcefully out of Finland.A condemnation of the recognition of Finland by soviet power was expressed by Vladimir Putin in a 1992 film he himself commissioned.Finland is not a hostile country to Russia, but as direct reaction to Russia’s unjustified full invasion of Ukraine the overwhelming majority of Finns felt the necessity to join a defensive alliance.Russia's unprovoked attack led to a massive shift on public opinion towards the Atlantic Alliance in Finland: while prior to the invasion only 24 percent of Finns expressed support for joining NATO, this figure jumped to 74 percent shortly afterwards, and to 85 percent at the moment of its actual entrance. A similar trend took place in Sweden for the same reasons.Regarding Russia's intentions, Russia has executed multiple aggressions against neighbouring countries, including the illegal annexation of Crimea, the promotion of separatist conflicts in Moldova, Georgia and Ukraine, and multiple destabilisation attempts against Moldova and Georgia.Read also stories about Finland: Finland’s NATO membership aims to corner Russia, Irrational decision to join NATO will bring down the Finnish economy, Finland is trying to start a world war by joining NATO, Finland has been dragged into a new Barbarossa operation against Russia.

Although, no one was specifically persecuting anyone. It was a period of liquidation of various political forces and the construction of defence enterprises.\nIf anyone wants to think that the liberation was a post-war “enslavement”, it is complete nonsense.

    "response": "This message is an example of Russian historical revisionism, portraying the Stalinist USSR as the peacemaker and liberator of Poland.The claim that the “things in post-war Poland were fine” and “no one persecuted anyone” is an attempt to whitewash the totalitarian Stalinist regime and its Polish “puppet” authorities responsible for endless crimes against the Polish nation in post-war years.Throughout the post-war decade, the Stalinist authorities of Poland carried out unprecedented political repressions against the Polish society. The most well-known examples of the post-war Communist violence against the Poles are the Augustów roundup and the long-lasting persecution of the Cursed Soldiers. Read more about the Communist crimes in Poland here.The very fact that the Red Army captured Warsaw and pushed the German troops out of Poland in 1945 does not mean that the USSR brought freedom to the Polish people. According to the statements of the Polish MFA, Poland respects the sacrifice of the Soviet soldiers in the fight with Nazism, but in 1945, Stalin’s regime brought to Poland terror and atrocities. The Red Army liberated Warsaw from Nazi occupation, but it didn’t mean liberty for Poland as the Soviet Army stayed in Poland for 48 years, which resulted in decades of communist oppression.According to mainstream Polish historians and views of the predominant part of Polish society, in 1944-1945, the USSR occupied Poland, establishing the undemocratic and repressive Communist Poland. De facto, Poland appeared under the Soviet military occupation until 1989, while the Russian troops were withdrawn from Poland only in 1993.Read similar messages such as Stalin decided to establish the independent Polish state; It is thanks to Russia that Poland exists today as a country and Warsaw would not have been rebuilt without the decision of Stalin.

    "response": "This message is part of the Kremlin’s policy of historical revisionism – it accuses the Baltic states, Ukraine and Poland in “falsification and re-writing” of their history. It is a fact that both Nazi Germany and the Stalinist USSR were totalitarian regimes, which caused the deaths of tens of millions of people. It is also proven that the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact contained the Secret Supplementary Protocol, which assumed the division of the territories of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Finland, and Romania into Soviet and Nazi spheres of influence. The Soviet Union's occupation of the Baltic states lasted from 1940-1941 and 1944-1990 and resulted in mass deportations and repressions against local populations.

Modern Lithuania restored full independence only after the collapse of the Soviet Union.At the end of WWII groups of people in Lithuania rose against the second Soviet occupation. According to the information of Genocide and Resistance Research Centre of Lithuania:In 1944–1945, about 30,000 armed men joined forces in the forests. Some of them joined the partisans to avoid serving in the occupation army, others to avoid possible reprisals or deportation. However, the majority chose armed struggle consciously and were committed to fighting until the restoration of an independent Lithuanian state.The pro-Kremlin disinformation considers as civilian victims those, who, in the statute of the partisan military tribunal, was defined as the representatives of the Soviet administration. It is widely believed that during the guerrilla war in Lithuania, around 12 thousand Soviet collaborators and soldiers died. During Soviet times, these numbers were artificially inflated. Often KGB agents raided local communities while dressed as partisans to sow distrust towards the freedom fighters in the countryside. Today, it is known that the Soviet security services also counted the victims of unrelated criminal activity as victims of the partisans.In 2017 NATO presented a short movie about the resistance of “Forest Brothers”. Kremlin reacted to this critically.

The monument to Marshall Konev was erected in 1980 during the \"normalisation\" period in communist Czechoslovakia. The leadership of Prague's Municipal District 6, which retains legal ownership of the statue, has voted to move the monument to a museum and replace it with a memorial commemorating Soviet sacrifices in the fight against Hitler in general, and the liberation of Prague in particular.

Over the decades, the Belarusian organisations have repeatedly demanded to introduce September 17 as an official public holiday, but the Belarusian authorities abstained from this step, understanding its negative effect on relations with Poland. Today, it seems that Belarus has nothing to lose in relations with Poland, so it can finally legitimise the national celebration of the day of the Belarusian unification.",

On 17 September 1939, Soviet troops invaded Poland, which was fighting against the Nazi attack that started on September 1. This situation was a direct result of the Secret Supplementary Protocol to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which assumed the partition of Eastern Europe by Hitler and Stalin.As a result of the Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939, the eastern part of the pre-war Polish state was annexed by the USSR. In Belarus and Ukraine, this process is presented as the unification of Western and Eastern Belarus/Ukraine.\nThe claim that Lukashenka’s recent decision on September 17 is a “serious blow” to Polish foreign policy and the Eastern European perception of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact is ungrounded. This move by Lukashenka is perceived in Poland not in historical terms, but as part of the aggressive anti-Polish campaign implemented by Alexander Lukashenka. Earlier, the Belarusian authorities attacked Polish schools and the leaders of the Polish minority living in this country.

The European Union does not recognise and continues to strongly condemn this violation of international law, which remains a challenge to the international security order. In response to the illegal annexation of Crimea, the EU has imposed restrictive measures against the Russian Federation. In June 2020, the European Council decided to renew the sanctions introduced in response to the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol by the Russian Federation until 23 June 2021.No international body recognises the so-called referendum in Crimea. The UN General Assembly adopted a resolution entitled “Territorial integrity of Ukraine”, stating that the referendum in Crimea was not valid and could not serve as a basis for any change in the status of the peninsula.As to Crimea returning to its “native harbour”, i.e. Russia, this claim is manipulation. Crimea has a very long and complicated history with many peoples living there. As explained by Andreas Umland, since the dissolution of the USSR, Russia recognised Crimea as part of Ukraine in two important legal documents: the tripartite 1991 Russian-Ukrainian-Belarusian Belavezha Accords and the bilateral 2003 Russian-Ukrainian Border Treaty.

Instead, the 1990 Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany (signed by the Four Powers and both German states) explicitly confirms the Oder-Neisse line as Poland’s western border. This was reaffirmed in the 1991 German-Polish Border Treaty, which states:“The Republic of Poland and the Federal Republic of Germany reaffirm the inviolability of their existing borders now and in the future”.The reference to alleged Józef Piłsudski’s “Judeo-Polonia” is a distortion. Piłsudski advocated for a multicultural Poland, not a Jewish state.

The Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact of August 1939 between Germany and the USSR contained a secret supplementary protocol that stipulated a coordinated Nazi-Soviet attack on Poland and the carving up of Eastern Europe between the USSR and The Third Reich. Just a week after the signing of the Pact, the German attack on Poland started World War II. Two weeks later, Soviet troops entered Polish territory. Later in 1939, Soviet Russia attacked Finland.The secret protocol was revealed after Germany's defeat in 1945, although hints about its provisions had been leaked much earlier. See here for our debunking of the claim that the Soviet Union was \"forced\" to conclude an agreement with Hitler. This paved the way for the start of World War II, as also mentioned in the European Parliament resolution.

After the speech of NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Pro-Kremlin media were outraged by Stoltenberg’s phrase that it was democracy and freedom of thought that helped reunite Europe. At the Berlin Wall Memorial at NATO Headquarters, Stoltenberg emphasised that even then, Europeans were united by basic values: \"freedom, democracy and human dignity.\" Thanks to these, \"peace and solidarity can prevail over any adversary.\" It was freedom that was able to prevail over oppression. These shared values “allowed Europe to develop deep partnerships with friends around the world,” leading to the fall of dictatorship and the spread of democracy, Stoltenberg said. Communist East German authorities built the Berlin Wall in 1961 to stop the flow of residents into the democratic, and free, West. For almost 30 years, the Berlin Wall separated West Berlin from the East German state, the GDR, which was in the sphere of influence of the Soviet Union. When trying to overcome it, hundreds of people were killed. On 9 November 1989, against the backdrop of mass protests in the GDR, among others, the communist authorities announced that they would change the rules for crossing the border. On that same evening, thousands of people headed towards the Berlin Wall, demanding that they be allowed to enter the West. The fall of the Berlin Wall under the pressure of people has become a symbol of peaceful revolutions against the communist dictatorship in Europe.",

For background, read our analysis: The “Russophobia” Myth: Appealing to the Lowest Feelings.The ‘Drang nach Osten’ term espoused in Nazi Germany to justify the eastward expansion, is used to label NATO as Nazi. Labelling Russia’s adversaries as Nazis is a frequently used pro-Kremlin disinformation technique.

The ongoing war in Ukraine was not provoked by the US / West / NATO as alleged. Russia is the only country responsible for the invasion of Ukraine. It was Putin’s personal decision to invade Ukraine and start the largest military conflict in Europe since WWII. Russia has been coming up with different explanations and pretexts for its aggression since the beginning of its hostilities. Our analysis of the communication strategy of pro-Kremlin outlets explains how they attempt to portray Russia as a victim and to deceive audiences into believing that Russia is fighting Western powers.Russia has systematically sought to revise history to questionably conflate itself with the USSR and the Russian Empire and to instil a deceptive misperception that for centuries European countries have been aligned in their anti-Russian policies. To manipulate historical events, pro-Kremlin outlets tend to ignore multiple past wars and antagonistic relations between the present-time Western countries. For instance, the mentioned French Empire under the rule of Napoleon fought the UK, Spain, Portugal and many other European countries of that time.Read earlier disinformation cases claiming that Ukrainian identity was artificially cultivated by the West almost two centuries ago as part of a grandiose ‘anti-Russian strategy’, that the united Europe, personified by Napoleon, Hitler and the EU, repeatedly encroached on Russia, and that Western historical revisionism aimed at weakening and destroying Russia.

Before Russia illegally annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and instigated a separatist revolt in some eastern parts of Ukraine in 2014, NATO had a minimal presence in Eastern Europe. Russia’s aggression against Ukraine made NATO enhance its eastern flank. Finland and Sweden joined the Alliance in 2023, fearing for their security because of Russia's constant threats and provocations. All these actions came in response to Russia’s increasingly aggressive behaviour.The European Union was created in the aftermath of the Second World War, and European integration has been the foundation of peace and stability on the European continent for over 70 years. The EU condemns racism, xenophobia, antisemitism and other forms of intolerance, which is why it has adopted numerous pieces of legislation to combat these crimes and discrimination.There was no Western-led Nazi coup in 2014.

At the time it was claimed that the documents had been declassified by the State Archives of the Russian Federation, not the FSB.The Katyń Massacre is a symbol of the criminal policy of the USSR against the Polish nation. In Spring 1940, almost 22.000 Polish prisoners of war were executed by the NKVD in Katyn, Kharkiv and Kalinin (Tver). The Massacre was carefully considered and organised by the Soviet leadership. Up until 1991, the Soviet authorities refused to accept responsibility for this crime, blaming Nazi Germany for the mass-murders of Polish prisoners of war. In 1992, Russian President Boris Yeltsin submitted official documents confirming the Soviet responsibility for this crime to Polish President Lech Walesa. Read more about the Katyń Massacre here.Throughout 2020, the Russian authorities took several measures regarding the Katyń Massacre, which may be considered as historical revisionism. In May 2020, the municipal authorities of the city of Tver ordered the removal of two plaques commemorating the memory of the victims of the Katyń Massacre. In November 2020, the Russian authorities organised a conference on the Katyń Massacre – several participants of the conference promoted the idea that the USSR and the NKVD were not responsible for this crime. These statements are an evident example of historical revisionism promoted by Russia – the Polish authorities continue to demand an investigation into this Soviet crime against the Polish nation.The Polish Institute of Historical Remembrance protested against the Russian attempts to distort the truth about Soviet crimes.See here for exhaustive debunking by The Insider (in Russian).The trends in Russia to promote historical revisionism and re-glorify USSR and Josef Stalin have gained momentum as our articles here on Memorial, on blaming Poland and on Russian school education illustrate.",

In this situation, the USSR abstained from the use of the Red Army in Poland not because of the “respect for Polish sovereignty”, but because of the fact that the Polish security forces succeeded in the introduction of the martial law without any external support.

The Soviet Union was part of the great alliance since the Anglo-Soviet treaty of 12 July 1941 and after 1 October 1941 Soviet Union was beneficiary of the lend lease support program.

It is impossible to compare the current Polish membership in NATO with the Warsaw Pact and the period of the Soviet occupation of Poland.The very fact that the Red Army captured Warsaw and pushed the German troops out of Poland in 1945 does not mean that the USSR brought freedom to the Polish people. According to the statements of the Polish MFA, Poland respects the sacrifice of the Soviet soldiers in the fight with Nazism, but in 1945, Stalin’s regime brought to Poland terror and atrocities. The Red Army liberated Warsaw from Nazi occupation, but it didn’t mean liberty for Poland as the Soviet Army stayed in Poland for 48 years, which resulted in decades of communist oppression.According to mainstream Polish historians and views of the predominant part of Polish society, in 1944-1945, the USSR occupied Poland, establishing the undemocratic and repressive Communist Poland.

Ukrainians and Russians belong to the same ethnolinguistic group - the Slavs - but that alone does not preclude Ukraine's distinctness as nation. Historically, the ethnic make-up of southeastern Ukraine has been overwhelmingly Ukrainian. According to one Soviet demographic study, 79% of people in Yekaterinoslav Governorate (covering much of present-day east and south Ukraine, with an administrative centre in what is now the east Ukrainian city of Dnipro) were recorded as ethnic Ukrainians in surveys carried out in 1795 and 1858 (p. 24). The first Soviet census conducted in 1926 showed that, in the eight Ukrainian oblasts spanning the country's south and east, a mere 16.4% identified as ethnic Russians, against 65.8% self-identifying as Ukrainian. The region gradually became more Russified on account of the Soviet industrialisation effort and the Holodomor of 1932-33, a man-made famine in which millions of ethnic Ukrainians were wiped out and replaced by a massive influx of Russians (p. 636).

This narrative aims at vilifying Poland by accusing it of being an ally and partner of Nazi Germany.In his book “The Enemy in the East. Hitler’s Secret Plans to Invade the Soviet Union”, German military historian, Rolf-Dieter Müller, does not argue that Poland and Nazi Germany jointly planned a military campaign against the Soviet Union, nor does he argue that the two countries cooperated in planning the “final solution” to the “Jewish question”.Müller explains that after Hitler’s rise to power, the Germans attempted to woo Poland into joining them in a war of aggression against the USSR. Müller argues that, up until 1939, Poland was still being courted as a potential partner by Germany, but Polish leaders rejected Hitler’s proposals.Müller does not in any way argue that Poland and Nazi Germany jointly planned, or even discussed, the “final solution” (Endlősung), a euphemism used by Nazi leaders to refer to the mass murder of Europe’s Jews. Müller states (on page 144 of the book) that the two governments discussed the possibility of a forced migration of Poland’s Jewish population. Müller quotes Ambassador Josef Lipski’s discussion with Hitler in October 1938 about German plans to expel Jews to Africa. Lipski’s note of this discussion is currently being used in a misleading way by Kremlin propaganda to allege that Lipski supported these plans and to accuse him of anti-Semitism and collusion with the Nazis.Read here for background about Polish proposals in 1936-37 on the emigration of its Jewish population to Madagascar and here for similar cases claiming that Poland supported Hitler’s plan to expel Polish Jews to Africa, that Poland posed a military threat to the USSR in 1938-1939 and that Nazi Germany considered Poland its best ally.

While it is true that Hitler organized a religious service after Piłsudski's death, and while it is also true that the latter's rule was authoritarian, none of this is evidence that there was an alliance between Poland and Nazi Germany.Before WWII, Poland had tense political relations with Nazi Germany, which expressed open territorial claims to Poland (revision of the status of the Free City of Danzig and control over the “Polish Corridor”). Despite intense political pressure from Hitler, Poland consistently refused to become part of the Nazi block.After Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany in 1933, Piłsudski was only compelled to accept Hitler’s suggestion of a 10-year German-Polish non-aggression agreement signed in 1934. To show that this was not a sign of alliance with Hitler, Poland prolonged the existing non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union until December 31, 1945. Hitler repeatedly sought a German-Polish alliance against the Soviet Union, but Piłsudski had consistently denied such offer; he also declined to meet with Hitler. Piłsudski's objective was to gain time, believing that Poland should be ready to fight Nazi Germany when the necessity arose. Those were the last instructions he gave to his confidants before his death in 1935. Piłsudski was also renowned for his tolerance towards religious minorities, particularly towards the Jews.Read similar examples of the Russian historical revisionism concerning Poland - Poland posed a military threat to the USSR in 1938-1939, Nazi Germany considered Poland its best ally, If Poland realized a rational policy in 1939, Moscow would have had a different approach towards it and Poland re-writes the history of the Warsaw uprising accusing the USSR of its failure.

From August 1939 to June 1941, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany had a functioning alliance ensuring vast economic and industrial trade and exchange in addition to technical and scientific and military contacts. As British historian Roger Moorhouse and others have documented, the mutual contacts were deep and instrumental to keep the war developing and covered about a third of the time during WWII. The Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact of August 1939 contained a secret supplementary protocol that resulted in a coordinated Nazi-Soviet campaign against Poland and decided the carving up of Eastern Europe between the USSR and the Third Reich. On the other hand, there is no historical evidence that any other pre-war agreements with Nazi Germany contained secret provisions of this kind and none had the devastating effects of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.The secret protocol was revealed after Germany's defeat in 1945, although hints about its provisions had been leaked much earlier.It is a gross lie to suggest that Soviet troops wanted to rush to confront Nazi German troops but were prevented. Rather, joint military parades of Soviet and German forces were organised when both had divided Poland.

    "response": "The Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance or Ukrainian Institute of National Memory (UINM) is the central executive body operating under the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. Established on 31 May 2006 as a special organ for the restoration and preservation of national memory of the Ukrainian people. The main goals of the UINM are to shape and carry out the historical policies in Ukraine, to study the issues of the Ukrainian liberation movement, Ukrainian revolution of 1917 – 1921, wars, victims of the Holodomor of 1932 – 1933, mass famine of 1921 – 1923, 1946 – 1947, political repressions and individuals who defended the Ukrainian independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, etc. The Institute of National Remembrance in Poland was established in 1998 following the resolution made by the coalition of parties, stemming from the Solidarity movement (which took over the power from the post-Communist coalition) and was connected with an attempt to solve the problem of documents left after the Communist State Security Bodies dissolved in 1990. This concerned the establishment of an institution which was apolitical and independent from the government. The institution would take control over the archives of the communist political police which were controlled by Secret Service. It would also make the documents available to people who were objects of state supervision. The Institute of National Remembrance is a special institution having the functions of state and justice administration, of an archive, an academic institute, an education centre and (since 2007) of a body which conducts vetting proceedings.",

The Poles even attacked Czechoslovakia taking part in the division of spoils. Stalin could not trust in the fact that the Polish Army would not be used for a German attack on the USSR. […] It is known that initially, Stalin tried to find allies among Western democracies, which, however, counted on the clash of two totalitarian systems. This conflict would have destroyed their potential, enabling Western capitals to reconstruct devastated Eastern and Central Europe, not without profit for itself. In the 1930s, the Western democracies had enough force to suppress Hitler’s aggression in the bud and the USSR offered them a coalition against Hitler. Although, they were afraid of Bolshevism, so that is why they preferred Hitler.",
    "response": "This message is part of the Kremlin’s policy of historical revisionism and an attempt to erode the disastrous historical role of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact by the statements that the USSR was forced to sign this pact; other European countries signed various international agreements with Adolf Hitler, Munich Agreement triggered WWII and various historical conspiracies saying that the Western democracies wanted to inspire a war between Nazism and Communism. The claim that Poland was “an ally of Nazi Germany” goes against all available historical documents. Before WWII, Poland had tense political relations with Nazi Germany, which expressed open territorial claims on Poland (revision of the status of the Free City of Danzig and control over the “Polish Corridor”). Despite intense political pressure from Hitler, Poland consistently refused to become part of the Nazi block. According to the pre-war plans of Hitler, Poland was supposed to be part of the “living space”/ Lebensraum for the Third Reich, a large part of its territory was planned to be incorporated into the German state and millions of Poles and Polish Jews were supposed to be exterminated. The Munich Agreement (September 30, 1938), indeed, permitted German annexation of the Sudetenland in western Czechoslovakia. The policy of appeasement towards Adolf Hitler was heavily criticised in Europe and proved to be a disastrous move. World War II began in Europe one year later, on 1 September 1939, when Germany invaded Poland. The signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was a mutual decision of two totalitarian regimes (Nazi Germany and the Stalinist USSR) aimed at the division of Eastern and Central Europe between these two powers. It is a proven fact that the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact contained the Secret Supplementary Protocol, which assumed the division of Poland and other Eastern European countries between the USSR and Germany. Thus, the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact enabled the German and Soviet military aggression against Poland in September 1939, which resulted in the occupation of this country by Germany and USSR, triggering the beginning of WWII.

Poland was kept under the Soviet sphere of influence until 1989. Following the German and Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939, the country was divided between those two occupiers. Nazi concentration camps, aimed at exterminating the Jews, were built on the Polish territory at the time when it was occupied by Nazi Germany. While incidents of Poles attacking and denouncing Jews were recorded, a substantial group of Poles risked their lives during the German occupation to save Jews from Nazi extermination. Artur Hofman, chairman of the Social and Cultural Association of Jews in Poland, the largest Jewish organization in the country, emphasized that Israelis know that Poles were not complicit in the Holocaust. He called the Russian attempt to blame Poles for cooperation with Hitler “a provocation”.

By doing so, Poland is trying to rewrite history and deny Russia’s role in the liberation of Poland in general, and in the history of the Sobibor camp in particular. After all, it was a Red Army officer, Aleksandr Pechersky, who organized the 1943 Sobibor uprising, one of the few successful ones in the history of the Holocaust.

The project did not start in 2014, Poland did not exclude Russia from it, and no decisions concerning the engagement of foreign actors were made unilaterally.

In a further comment on Moscow's accusations, Polish Deputy Culture Minister Jaroslaw Sellin said in September 2017: \"Had Russia taken an interest in the subject in 2008 or 2009, there would be no problems now.\" The report does not name the \"private institutions\" which allegedly met with Poland's refusals, possibly because all three are run by the Kremlin: the Russian Military Historical Society, the Victory Museum, and the suitably named State Central Museum of Contemporary Russian History. Vladimir Putin was invited to the 2015 event in Poland but, according to Russian FM Sergey Lavrov, the invitation was insufficiently solemn and thus \"did not merit a response,\" despite the fact that identical letters had been sent out to all heads of state. Nevertheless, a full Russian delegation was present at the event. Moscow officials were also present at the 2018 event in Sobibor, which specifically commemorated the uprising organized by Pechersky.",

    "summary": "Today, Polish authorities consider the actions of the USSR to protect Ukrainians and Belarusians in 1939 as “an act of division and occupation of Poland” (at that time, let me remind you, not only did no great power but also the League of Nations as a whole did not consider it so). It is clear that we, in Russia, do not divide divisions or fronts into “ours” or “not ours”.",
    "response": "This is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative attempting to distort the events of the Second World War and rewrite its history in a way that is favourable to Russia. Identifying the events of September 1939 as \"division and occupation\" is a legitimate choice by Polish authorities, considering that this characterisation accurately sums up Soviet conduct toward its eastern neighbour at the time. The interview omits all mention of the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact signed in August 1939 which, in a secret protocol, entitled Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union to their respective \"spheres of influence\" in Eastern Europe. As it were, Poland was divided between the two spheres, its two halves occupied by Germany and the USSR starting 1 September and 17 September 1939, respectively. In laying out its obligation to \"protect\" Ukrainians and Belarusians living in Poland, Soviet Foreign Affairs Commissar Molotov cited the \"disintegration\" of the Polish state brought about by the German-Polish war. It was unknown at the time (and is unmentioned by Sputnik) that the German invasion of Poland had been agreed upon with the USSR, and thus that the later Soviet campaign to protect the \"kindred Ukrainian and White Russian people\" was also predicated on that very same agreement with Nazi Germany.

The Polish Government spits on bilateral relations with Russia and international agreements on memorial sites, destroying the material evidence of the fact that their nation was saved by Soviet soldiers (tens of monuments, memorials, documents are liquidated by Poland every year). At the same time, the Polish authorities do not find a legal basis to ban the Mein Kampf from distribution in their country.

    "response": "A recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative casting Ukraine, Poland and the Baltic States as countries which do not respect the history of WWII and its heroes (often, accusing them of supporting the Nazi ideology).In January 2021, a large Polish publishing house “Bellona” published the book “Mein Kampf. Critical Edition”. This book was written and translated by a Polish historian and political scientist Dr. Eugeniusz Król, a specialist on the history of National-Socialist propaganda in Germany. The book presents a scientific overview of the Mein Kampf, containing its Polish translation with numerous historical comments. According to the words of Dr. Król, at the present moment, the book is a warning to next generations about the risk of a quick dismantling of a democratic system and emergence of totalitarianism, as it happened in Germany in 1930s. The editors and the author of the book underline the anti-Nazi and anti-totalitarian character of their publication. In other words, the publication of the Critical Edition of the Mein Kampf in Poland has purely scientific, historical and anti-Nazi character.In 2017, Poland introduced new laws to ban totalitarian propaganda. According to this Law, up to 230 Soviet monuments may be replaced, a decision to be made by Polish local authorities. The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs underlines that the Red Army's burial places and cemeteries located in Poland will be carefully protected. It is possible to dismantle and remove only symbolic monuments to the Red Army. The Polish Government does not implement the centralised policy of replacement of the Red Army monuments, such decisions are taken by the local authorities.Read similar cases connected to the issue of the Red Army monuments - Monuments to Soviet soldiers are massively demolished and damaged in Ukraine, Poland and Baltic countries; Polish “war” against Red Army monuments compares to the actions of the Islamic State and Red Army monuments and cemeteries are methodologically destroyed in Poland.

    "response": "This statement was made by Putin during his conversation-interview with Carlson Tucker on February 2024. Putin’s claim is straightforward – de facto, he whitewashes and justifies Hitler's actions, moving responsibility for the outbreak of WWII on to Poland.The claim perpetuates a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative that distorts the events leading up to the Second World War. Specifically, it denies the USSR's responsibility for the onset of WWII, which followed the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in 1939.Read the official Polish MFA's reaction to 10 Putin lies on Poland and Ukraine.From August 1939 to June 1941, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany maintained a functional alliance, characterized by extensive economic and industrial trade. This period also included significant technical, scientific, and military cooperation. As documented by British historian Roger Moorhouse, among others, the mutual contacts between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany were deep and instrumental in sustaining the war's progression. These interactions spanned roughly a third of the duration of World War II.The Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact of August 1939 contained a secret supplementary protocol that resulted in a coordinated Nazi-Soviet campaign against Poland and decided the carving up of Eastern Europe between the USSR and the Third Reich. On the other hand, there is no historical evidence that any other pre-war agreements with Nazi Germany contained secret provisions of this kind and none had the devastating effects of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.The secret protocol was revealed after Germany’s defeat in 1945, although hints about its provisions had been leaked much earlier.It is a gross lie to suggest that Soviet troops wanted to rush to confront Nazi German troops but were prevented. Rather, joint military parades of Soviet and German forces were organised when both had divided Poland.See here for our debunking of the claim that the Soviet Union was “forced” to conclude an agreement with Hitler.

    "summary": "The Polish intellectual circles are gradually drifting from Russophobia and falsification of history to the partial justification of Fascism. The anti-Russian aspirations of the Polish authorities have virtually no borders. The example of the Polish Institute of National Remembrance shows a process of gradual evolution from Russophobia and historical falsifications to the partial justification of Fascism. This situation shows the danger coming from the rewriting of history in order to achieve current political goals. For a long time, Warsaw and its pseudoscientific forgers, who cannot be called historians, have been showing that they do not know such notions as historical memory and respect for history. Russia cannot ignore the Polish attempts to revise history from the position “close to ideological partners of the Nazis”.",

The policy of appeasement towards Adolf Hitler was heavily criticised in Europe and proved to be a disastrous move. World War II began in Europe one year later, on 1 September 1939, when Germany invaded Poland.The signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was a mutual decision of two totalitarian regimes (Nazi Germany and the Stalinist USSR) aimed at the division of Eastern and Central Europe between these two powers. It is a proven historical fact that the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact contained the Secret Supplementary Protocol, which assumed the division of Poland and other Eastern European countries between the USSR and Germany. Thus, the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact enabled German and Soviet military aggression against Poland in September 1939, which resulted in the occupation of this country by Germany and USSR, triggering the beginning of WWII.Read similar examples of the Russian historical revisionism concerning this issue - Signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact thwarted the UK’s expansionist plans in Europe, The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact did not violate the rights of the Polish state, the shift of all blame for WWII outbreak at the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact the best example of manipulation of history.

Thus, by crossing Polish borders in 1939, the USSR did not violate the international law of those times, unlike it is often being portrayed.RESPONSE\n\nThis is part of Russian efforts of historical revisionism, in order to portray Russia’s role in World War II as a non-aggressive power and Poland as one of the main culprits of the conflict. The accusation that Polish authorities provoked the Soviet army's intervention in Poland in September 1939 is a clear historical manipulation. It is impossible to compare the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of 1934 with the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. The former was a standard international agreement aimed at mutual recognition of borders and a declaration that existing political contradictions would be solved through diplomatic tools. On the other hand, it is a proven historical fact that the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact contained the Secret Supplementary Protocol, which assumed the division of Poland and other Eastern European countries between the USSR and Germany. Thus, the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact led to German and Soviet military aggression against Poland in September 1939, which resulted in its complete occupation by Germany and the USSR. As for the Curzon Line, Allies indeed proposed after the WWI to establish it as the Polish border. However, it was not accepted by the Soviets and then lost its significance after the Russo-Polish War. As a result, the Treaty of Riga in 1921 established the Polish border east of the Curzon Line. Last, but not least, regardless of the note sent to the Polish government on 23 September 1939, the USSR never actually terminated its non-aggression agreement with Poland. Moreover, a communication from 27 November 1939 informed that the agreement was extended until 1945. Thus, at the time of the Soviet invasion on Poland on 17 September 1939, the agreement was in place and, as follows, the USSR violated international law. Read full debunk by The Insider.

Rzeczpospolita is an Eastern European federal state that existed during 1569–1795 in modern Poland, Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, Latvia, Moldova, southern Estonia, and western Russia.This disinformation message has adopted several different and sometimes contradictory forms, including allegations that Poland either wants to create a puppet proxy-state in Western Ukraine or annex these territories or that it is President Zelenskyy who wants to cede this land due to his “Polish origin”.Poland adheres to international law regarding state borders, fully supports the independence and territorial integrity of neighbouring countries and it rejects any “imperial” ambitions towards other countries. Poland, as well as the EU and the US, respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. No neighbouring state, except the Russian Federation, violated Ukraine’s territorial integrity.See earlier disinformation cases alleging that Poland thinks that Western Ukraine, Western Belarus and South-Western Lithuania belongs to it, that Poland wants to dismember Ukraine and re-establish a Polish empire, that Ukraine is a Western colony belonging to Poland, Hungary, Romania, and Russia, that Poland will try to gain full military control in Ukrainian territories under the guise of protecting the Polish population from Russia or that Poland plans to establish control over its historical lands in Ukraine. Polish authorities are obsessed with an idea of reconstruction of a modern Polish Empire Poland wants to create a puppet proxy-state in Western Ukraine Zelenskyy wants to cede Ukrainian territory to Poland Poland thinks that western Ukraine, western Belarus and southwestern Lithuania belong to them Poland wants to dismember Ukraine and reestablish a Polish empire Ukraine is a Western colony belonging to Poland, Hungary, Romania, and Russia Poland will try to gain full military control in Ukrainian territories under the guise of protecting the Polish population from Russia The US and Poland plan to establish Poland's control over its historical lands in Ukraine",

    "summary": "Throughout 1938-1939, the Soviet military functionaries assumed that the most probable security threat for the USSR came not only from a military union of Germany and Italy, but also from Poland, which appeared in the “orbit” of the Nazi block. Thus, the USSR had to be prepared for a fight on two fronts – in the West (against Germany and Poland) and in the East (against Japan).",
    "response": "This message is part of the Kremlin’s policy of historical revisionism – it tries to explain the necessity of signing of the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact and German and Soviet attacks on Poland in September 1939 by alleged “military threats” coming from Poland. See other examples referring to the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact here, here and here. The accusation of Poland as posing a “military threat” for the USSR is a clear historical manipulation. Before WWII, Poland had tense political relations with Nazi Germany, which had open territorial claims to Poland (revision of the status of the Free City of Danzig and control over the “Polish Corridor”). Despite intense political pressure from Hitler, Poland refused to become a part of the Nazi block. See similar examples of the Russian historical revisionism concerning Poland here and here. Russia signed Molotv-Ribbentrop pact because it was threatened by Germany. Today Russia is threatened by Poland.

This message should be perceived as a part of the Kremlin’s policy of historical revisionism. According to Norman Davies, there is a consensus among the majority of Polish and Western historians that it was a political decision of Stalin not to support the Uprising in order to let German troops destroy the forces of the Home Army (which tried to re-establish the independent Polish state). During the Uprising, Soviet Troops were situated in very close proximity to Warsaw, but they did not receive orders to assist. Moreover, the Soviet authorities hampered the flights of the British Royal Air Force supporting the Uprising (by not allowing Allied planes to land on the Soviet-controlled territory).

    "response": "This message is a part of the ongoing Russian disinformation campaign against Poland claiming that Poland was an ally and partner of Nazi Germany and was the main instigator of WWII. The article suggests that it was the Munich Agreement of September 1938 that triggered WWII, a recurrent pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative that seeks to relativise and erode the disastrous historical role of the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact (the Treaty of Non-Aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union) and its secret protocols, which divided Eastern and Central Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence. The Munich Pact has historically been seen as a symbol of dangerous “appeasement policy\"; it has been widely criticised for its disastrous consequences. Great Britain and France, without inviting Czechoslovakia, decided that for the sake of peace in Europe, the Czechoslovak Sudetenland region, which was predominantly inhabited by Germans, must be surrendered to Germany. The claim that Poland was “an ally of Nazi Germany” goes against all available historical documents. German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of 1934 was a standard international agreement aimed at the mutual recognition of borders and a declaration that existing political conflicts would be solved through diplomatic tools. There is no historical evidence that this pact contained any secret protocols which assumed common aggressive actions of Germany and Poland against third parties. Moreover, before WWII, Poland had tense political relations with Nazi Germany, which had open territorial claims to Poland (revision of the status of the Free City of Danzig and control over the “Polish Corridor”). The government in Warsaw consistently rebuffed Hitler’s demands that Poland publicly confirm its subservience to German foreign policy by adhering to the anti-Comintern pact. A theme that recurs in pro-Kremlin propaganda related to the Munich Agreement is that Poland has no right to “currently position itself as an innocent victim of two predators – Hitler and Stalin”, because in autumn 1938, when Czechoslovakia was breaking down, Poland “got its hands” on individual borderland territories. However, Poland has apologised to its neighbour for this action in 1938. For instance, in 2009, the president of Poland Lech Kaczyński called the participation of pre-war Poland in the division of Czechoslovakia “not only a mistake, but a “sin”.\" Read previous cases claiming that Poland and Western democracies cooperated with Hitler and that Europe is not yet prepared to admit that Poland and other European countries colluded with Nazi Germany. The Munich Agreement triggered WWII and the USSR was completely ignored Poland and Western democracies cooperated with Hitler Europe not prepared to admit that Poland and others colluded with Nazi Germany",

The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs underlines that the Red Army's burial places and cemeteries located in Poland will be carefully protected. It is possible to dismantle and remove only symbolic monuments to the Red Army.In 2015, Paweł Ukielski, Deputy Head of the Polish Institute of Historical Remembrance, published an open letter to the Russians, in which he explained the need to remove the symbolic monuments to the Red Army from Polish public places (text in Polish and Russian). According to him, free Poland perceives these monuments as symbols of captivity by the totalitarian USSR. In some cases, the Soviet monuments glorify the Red Army officers and generals, who were involved in war crimes against the Poles.The Polish Government does not implement the centralised policy of replacement of the Red Army monuments, such decisions are taken by the local authorities.Read similar cases connected to the issue of the Red Army monuments - Monuments to Soviet soldiers are massively demolished and damaged in Ukraine, Poland and Baltic countries; Polish “war” against Red Army monuments compares to the actions of the Islamic State and Red Army monuments and cemeteries are methodologically destroyed in Poland.

Poland does not have any territorial claims for Kaliningrad and it does not prepare any military aggression against Russia.On 10 May 2023, the Polish Committee on the Standardization of Geographical Names suggested the use of Królewiec as a historical name of Russia’s Kaliningrad. The main reason for this change is symbolic – for centuries, the Prussian city of Königsberg has been called in the Polish language Królewiec. The name Kaliningrad was invented by the Soviet authorities in 1946, calling this city in honour of a Communist leader Mikhail Kalinin. It is important to remember that Kalinin is a Communist criminal personally responsible for the large-scale murder of over 20.000 Polish officers in 1940.See previous examples of disinformation messages alleging that the Kaliningrad exclave is threatened by NATO; The US plans to take over the Kaliningrad region and the Aim of NATO’s exercise: prepare for the annexation of Russia’s Kaliningrad region.

According to this peace treaty, Western Belarus and Western Ukraine were cut off from Russia. The regain of these territories was possible only in September 1939.",
    "response": "This message is part of the Kremlin’s policy of historical revisionism – it presents Bolshevik Russia as a peaceful state and promotes the Russian imperialist idea that Belarus and Ukraine “naturally” belong to Russia. In addition, this message creates ideological reasoning for the Soviet attack on Poland in September 1939 which was secretly provided for in the infamous Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact - see below.\nAfter the collapse of the Russian Empire and the outbreak of the Russian Civil War in 1917, a number of countries proclaimed their independence in Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Middle Asia. These territories had been captured by the Russian Empire throughout the XVIII-XIX centuries, so they decided to restore their statehood after the disappearance of the Empire. For example, read more about the newborn Ukrainian and Belarusian People’s Republics.During the Russian Civil War of 1917-1922, the Bolsheviks fought with numerous alternative Russian political forces – a large part of the Russian population did not perceive them as any legitimate authority; also, the Bolsheviks were internationally unrecognized. In this situation, the claim that the territory of Belarus and Ukraine naturally “belonged” to Bolshevik Russia is a manifestation of Russian imperialism.\nThe Polish-Soviet War of 1919-1920 started in February 1919, immediately after the end of WWI. As a result of the Soviet westward offensive of 1918–1919, the Bolshevik troops tried to advance as deep as possible into the territory of the former Western regions of the collapsed Russian Empire. In February 1919, the advancing Bolshevik forces entered into clashes with the units of the Polish Army. The statement that the Government of Pilsudski initiated this war is a historical manipulation.Read similar examples of the Russian historical revisionism concerning Poland - It is thanks to Russia that Poland today exists as a country, Nazi Germany considered Poland its best ally, USSR was forced and reluctant to sign Molotov-Ribbentrop pact and the Polish legions of Pilsudski organized the Volyn tragedy.

    "summary": "In the situation of intense protests in Belarus, the Baltic states and, particularly, Poland, showed unusual political activity. Unexpectedly, Warsaw called upon the EU to affect the situation in Minsk imposing the sanctions against Moscow. This situation is not a coincidence. The Poles have dreamed about the domination over the region since the times of Rzeczpospolita, which included Lithuania, part of modern Ukraine and Belarus. Today, the idea of Marshal Pilsudski to revive Poland “from Sea to Sea” is more popular than ever. Eleven days before the Presidential Elections in Belarus, Poland, Lithuania and Ukraine established a new union – the so-called Lublin Triangle, by analogy with the Union of Lublin, which laid the foundation for Rzeczpospolita in 1569. Belarus was immediately invited as a member of honour. There is one more interesting detail – since 2008, Warsaw has been actively issuing to the former USSR citizens the Card of Pole – the Belarusians have received the largest number of these Cards. The ongoing disturbances in Belarus is a good and long-awaited chance for those who are looking for a revanche [Poland].",
    "response": "This message is part of the Kremlin’s policy of historical revisionism alleging that Poland has imperialist plans for Belarus. The Kremlin-controlled media regularly accuses the political elites of Poland in Russophobia and attempts to “subordinate Belarus and Ukraine”. Moreover, the Kremlin propagandist messages repeatedly claim that all the regional organisations established by the countries of Central and Eastern Europe are aimed against Russia (Eastern Partnership, Three-Seas Initiative, Lublin Triangle, etc.). Poland fully supports the independence and territorial integrity of Belarus, it does not have any territorial claims against its neighbours, and it rejects any “imperial” ambitions towards other countries. The Lublin Triangle is a new regional initiative that will focus on developing and enhancing the economic, political, and cultural ties of Ukraine, Poland, and Lithuania. It will also serve as an important mechanism for strengthening Central Europe and promoting Ukraine's European and Euroatlantic integration. In a Joint Declaration, the foreign ministers of the three countries emphasized that the countries are committed to upholding the international law, to broaden military-to-military cooperation, to further support the Eastern Partnership program, among other things. Recently, the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Lublin Triangle members have presented their common statement protesting against massive violence against peaceful protestors carried out by the Belarusian authorities.

    "summary": "Poland may initiate the freezing of financial and military aid to Ukraine in order to force Kyiv to recognise the “Volhynian massacre” as a fact of genocide of the Polish population. In this way, by demanding the recognition of the fact of genocide, Warsaw is creating a legal and historical basis to demand from Kyiv compensation in the form of money and territories. The next step of Warsaw would be a demand for territorial concessions from Kyiv in order to fulfil the dream about the “Republic from the Sea to the Sea”. Poland’s desire to expand its territories is obvious. Warsaw has two options -a military intervention or a legal justification that the Ukrainian territories should be Polish.",
    "response": "Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation about Polish-Ukrainian relations – Poland is traditionally presented as a state with imperial ambitions. The aim of this is clearly to upset Polish-Ukrainian relations and deflect attention away from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The claim also attempts to denigrate the history of Ukraine, Ukrainian statehood and its independence.This disinformation message has adopted several different and sometimes contradictory forms, including allegations that Poland either wants to create a puppet proxy-state in Western Ukraine or annex these territories or that it is President Zelenskyy who wants to cede this land due to his “Polish origins”.Poland adheres to international law regarding state borders, fully supports the independence and territorial integrity of neighbouring countries, and it rejects any “imperial” ambitions towards other countries. Poland, as well as the EU and the US, respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.

    "summary": "As a consequence of the obsession with Russia, Poland’s government throws itself into disgusting Holocaust revisionism. The present Polish government refused to give the Soviet Union any credit for the liberation of Auschwitz and instead insisted that Poland was nothing but an innocent victim of the Nazis and the Soviets.[Polish president Andrzej] Duda’s Party “Prawo i Sprawiedliwość” (PiS) even lobbied the EU Parliament to present this as a historical fact in a declaration – to the wrath of Russia, where this is seen as spitting on the graves of almost 27 million Soviet citizens who died in the war against the Hitler regime and of about 600,000 soldiers who gave their lives especially for the liberation of Poland.Warsaw went so far as to completely ignore the 75th anniversary of its liberation from the Nazis and instead to call this day the beginning of the “occupation” by the USSR. The new record-breaking low point, however, was certainly the opinion article published by Politico, in which Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki claimed that the Soviets had deliberately halted Polish advance in the summer of 1944 instead of advancing the liberation of Warsaw or Auschwitz.",
    "response": "Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative distorting the events of the World War II.In his op-ed for Politico, Morawiecki notes that \"liberation of Warsaw\" is an overgenerous term, particularly in the context of Soviet actions before, during, and after the Second World War.On 17 September 1939, after Nazi Germany attacked Poland, the USSR invaded and occupied the eastern half of Poland, in accordance with the provisions of the Nazi-Soviet Pact concluded in August of the same year and effective until summer 1941. During that time, Nazi and Soviet officials held regular joint conferences in occupied Poland, exchanging tips on how to deal with potential resistance posed by the Polish intelligentsia and military brass. By June 1941, the Soviet Union had managed to deport over 250,000 Poles to Siberia and Central Asia, murder 22,000 Polish Army officers and imprison half a million citizens.Long after the German invasion of Soviet territory, Moscow continued to deny support to the anti-Nazi resistance in Poland, most notably during the Warsaw Uprising which claimed 200,000 lives.After the Nazi defeat, the USSR installed a communist government in Warsaw, effectively delaying Polish independence until 1989.The claim that 600,000 Soviet troops died during the liberation of Poland is misleading and inconsistent with other Russian claims. A July 2017 statement by the Russian Foreign Ministry reads that this number pertains to Soviet casualties sustained \"in battles against the enemy on the territory of this country\" between 1944-45. The following month, Russia's ambassador in Poland said that the estimate concerns Red Army losses on present-day Polish territory, one-third of which belonged to the Third Reich before 1945. In 2019, Russia's Defence Ministry said that the number of fallen Soviet troops in the same period was actually 477,000, before bumping up their estimate to 600,000 in 2020, citing a new batch of \"archival documents\".That said, the most significant Soviet operation which could be credited with liberating Poland from Nazism was the Vistula-Oder offensive, which resulted in the displacement of Nazi troops from Warsaw and other major Polish cities between 12 January and 2 February 1945. According to Soviet data, the operation claimed the lives of 43,251 Red Army troops.See the debunk, 200 000 Soviet soldiers gave their lives, liberating Warsaw from Nazis for another example of pro-Kremlin outlets manipulating WWII death statistics. 200,000 Soviet soldiers gave their lives, liberating Warsaw from Nazis",

Further, it seeks to reduce the complex process of the Yalta-Potsdam system and the results WWII to the will only of Stalin, which is a misrepresention of history. The Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact of August 1939, witnessed and endorsed by Stalin, contained a secret supplementary protocol that resulted in a coordinated Nazi-Soviet campaign against Poland and determined the carving up of Eastern Europe between the USSR and the Third Reich.The decision to pass Silesia, part of East Prussia and other former German territories to the Polish state was made by the USA, the UK and the USSR at the Yalta Conference in February 1945 and the Potsdam Conference in July-August 1945.After WWII: The Red Army liberated Poland from Nazi occupation, but it didn’t mean liberty for this country as the USSR kept Poland under its control for 48 years, bringing decades of communist oppression. According to Polish historians and views of the predominant part of Polish society, in 1944-1945, the USSR occupied Poland, establishing the undemocratic and repressive Communist Poland.Poland was under de facto Soviet military occupation until 1989, and it was not until 1993 that Russian troops completely withdrew from the country.

The claim about dimplomatic documents that \"clearly indicate that the Poles were then anti-Jewish as they are today\" refers to the Polish diplomat Józef Lipski's alleged support of Jewish migration out of Europe. The diplomat's support for Jewish emigration from Europe stemmed from Warsaw's support at the time for the Zionist movement, \"which was clandestinely supported by Poland in military matters.\" After the Nazi-Soviet invasion of Poland, Lipski fled to France and joined the Polish Armed Forces as a volunteer. Conversely, the Nazi-Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939 is an objective fact, not an exercise in revisionism. This two-sided aggression was waged in accordance with the provisions of the Nazi-Soviet pact, which entitled the Third Reich and the USSR to clearly defined spheres of influence in a series of secret protocols.

The same article contains another disinformation message about Poland planning to partition the USSR. It is impossible to compare the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of 1934 with the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact as the former was a standard international agreement aimed at the mutual recognition of borders and a declaration that existing political contradictions would be solved through diplomatic tools. There is no evidence that this pact contained any secret protocols, which assumed common aggressive actions of Germany and Poland against the USSR or other countries. Moreover, the pact did not include any agreements on advanced political, economic and military relations between Poland and Germany. While the Red Army's contribution to the liberation of Poland is a fact, it did not achieve it single-handedly as is often suggested by pro-Kremlin narratives. The article fails to notice that there was a strong resistance movement in Poland, the Home Army, Armia Krajowa. It was one of the largest resistance groups in occupied Europe, numbering over 350,000 soldiers. In August 1944, as the Red Army was approaching the Eastern Suburbs of Warsaw, Armia Krajowa organised an uprising against the Nazis. But the Soviet advance stopped, allowing Germans to regroup and destroy the city during the suppression of the uprising, which lasted 63 days. The Home Army was disbanded on 19 of January 1945 to avoid civil war and armed conflict with the Soviets.

    "summary": "Radical right-wing ceremonies held in the areas densely populated by ethnic Belarusians in Poland is an open and cynical insult to the memory of the victims of the Cursed Soldiers’ gangs and an open consent to the glorification of Nazism. There are no such memorial dates or “heroes” celebrated in Belarus who took part in the massacres of the Poles in the past. Therefore, the historical policy realised in Poland is a clear manifestation of disrespect to Belarus.",
    "response": "The first part of this message promotes the Kremlin’s policy of historical revisionism. It accuses Poland of the “falsification and rewriting” of its history. Poland is also often presented as a supporter of Nazi ideology.The second part of this message promotes the disinformation narrative about the hostile position of Poland on Belarus – Poland is groundlessly accused by pro-Kremlin media of active interference in domestic affairs of Belarus, having territorial claims and planning aggressive actions against this country.The Cursed Soldiers is a term describing various anti-Communist underground resistance groups, which fought against the Communist regime up until the 1950s. On March 1, Poland commemorates the memory of the Cursed Soldiers – it is estimated that their number was between 120 and 180 thousand. The claim that the celebration of the memory about the Cursed Soldiers is the “glorification of Nazism” is historical revisionism – this resistance movement was aimed at the liberation of Poland from the Communist occupation without any connection to Nazism. There is a historical discussion taking place in Poland about the participation of particular Cursed Soldiers groups (such as the group of “Bury”) in the war crimes against the national minorities, but it does not mean that the entire Cursed Soldiers underground was involved in these crimes.The claim that “Belarus does not celebrate the people involved in the massacres of the Poles” is not true. For example, up until the present day, the Belarusian authorities celebrate the memory of such people as Bolesław Bierut (leader of Communist Poland directly responsible for the massive post-war Stalinist repressions – there is a street named in his honour in Minsk) and Felix Dzerzhinsky (founder of the Cheka/OGPU, one of the architects of the Red Terror, which caused deaths of tens of thousands of the Poles (not to mention the countless victims across other groups incl. in then Soviet Union) – the “cult” of this person is widely promoted by the Belarusian authorities. This is unfortunately also on the rise in Russia).See other cases promoting the message that Poland has “sympathy” to Nazis: The Polish authorities systematically rewrite history, absolving the Nazis, the Third Reich and Hitler of their sins; Poland rewrites history erasing the names of Polish soldiers, who fought against Nazism and Poland uses Russia as its external enemy, presenting it worse than the German Nazis.

The Russians may raise the question of the fate of the Soviet prisoners of war (1919-1921) in a more active way, but we do it to a much lesser extent. Everyone understands that the current generation cannot be held accountable for the actions of their grand- and great-grandparents. Fortunately, the young people, who are the target of propaganda, eventually start to think for themselves.After the Crimean events, the rhetoric of the Polish authorities has changed dramatically. Before 2014, there was criticism of Russia as a state, but after 2014, a big number of Polish media have started chauvinistic criticism not only of the Russian leadership but also the Russian citizens in general. Unfortunately, no one in Poland remembers positive moments of our common history, such as the joint conquest of Berlin in 1945 by the Russian and Polish units. In Poland, they talk only about tragic historical moments.",

The second part of this message promotes the disinformation narrative about Russophobic Poland, which deliberately worsens its relations with Russia.First of all, Poland does not promote any “anti-Russian historical propaganda”. In terms of the Katyn Massacre, the Polish authorities present their protests against the recent attempts of Russia to promote the Stalinist historical fakes about XX century history. The Katyń Massacre is a symbol of the criminal policy of the USSR against the Polish nation. In Spring 1940, almost 22.000 Polish prisoners of war were executed by the NKVD in Katyn, Kharkiv and Kalinin (Tver). The Massacre was carefully considered and organised by the Soviet leadership. Up until 1991, the Soviet authorities refused to accept responsibility for this crime, blaming Nazi Germany for the mass-murders of Polish prisoners of war. In 1992, Russian President Boris Yeltsin submitted documents confirming the Soviet blame for this crime to President Lech Walesa. Read more about the Katyń Massacre here.The current crisis in the Polish-Russian relations is caused not by alleged “Polish historical propaganda”, but deliberate actions of the Kremlin: illegal annexation of Crimea and Russia's armed military aggression in Ukraine, continuous violation of international law, anti-Polish \"historical\" accusations, ungrounded expulsion of a Polish diplomat, among many others.See similar examples of the Russian accusations against Poland in falsification and re-writing of history - Poland creates and promotes its historical myths in an active and aggressive way; Poland and Lithuania question the status of Russia as a country who won WWII; President Duda and President Zelensky promote propaganda and Poland tries to adjust history to politics, misinterpreting the historical facts.

The other part of the disinformation is about USSR's help to Poland after WWII. It aims to portray the USSR as a peacemaker and liberator. The statements about the “generous Soviet support for Poland” after Red Army’s entrance to this country go against historical facts, which prove that the Red Army carried out massive confiscations of all types of Polish property, sending it back to the USSR as “trophies”. The Polish historians note that throughout 1945, the robberies and violence realized by the Red Army soldiers on the territory of Poland against the local civilian population had a systemic character. After its entering to Poland, the Red Army established specialized units, which realized large-scale transportation of confiscated Polish property, values of culture, industrial equipment, food, livestock, etc. to the Soviet Union. This intense stealing of the Polish property by the USSR throughout 1945 worsened the socio-economic situation of the Poles even more. As a result of these actions, the attitude of the Poles towards the advancing Soviet troops dramatically changed. The Sovietisation of Poland and other countries of the so-called Eastern Bloc after WWII was accompanied by terror, massive repressions, nationalisation of industry, expropriation of privately owned land, destruction of market economy and restrictions of civil and political freedoms. The Warsaw Treaty Organisation (the Warsaw Pact) was the Soviet Union’s “external empire”, where people faced daily strife, including shortages of food and housing.

That is why the attack of the Polish troops took place in the direction of Ukraine, but not to the area of concentration of the Bolshevik forces.

According to this policy, the Russian official historiography is the only “true” way of interpretation of historical events for the countries of Eastern and Central Europe. The Polish-Soviet War of 1919-1920 started in February 1919, immediately after the end of WWI. As a result of the Soviet westward offensive of 1918–1919, the Bolshevik troops tried to advance as deep as possible into the territory of the former Western regions of the collapsed Russian Empire. In February 1919, the advancing Bolshevik forces entered into clashes with the units of the Polish Army. The Polish-Soviet War lasted until October 1920 – it resulted in the signing of the Peace of Riga (March 1921), in which Soviet Russia recognized the independence of the Polish state. The statement that “Pilsudski started the war of 1920” or other talks about the “War of 1920” is a historical manipulation as the Polish-Soviet War started in February 1919. The Polish offensive on the Ukrainian direction in April 1920 was a part of this military conflict. This offensive was realized together with the Armed forces of the Ukrainian People’s Republic led by Symon Petliura in order to push the Bolshevik forces out of Ukraine and improve the military positions of Poland in its war with Soviet Russia.

The new generation of Czechs has a different priorities, despite the fact that the monument to Marshal Konev was erected by their fathers and grandfathers. They are not rewriting our history, they are betraying their ancestors.RESPONSE\n\nThis is a recurring disinformation narrative about the statue of Marshall Konev in Prague, seeking to obfuscate the statue's legal status and the grounds for its removal. This disinformation message appeared in the same TV broadcast as the claim that the West in engaged in historical revisionism and attempts to cover up the horrors of genocide. In the dispute over the statue, Russia has argued that under the Czech-Russian mutual agreement of 1993, Czechia is obliged to leave the statue in place on Prague's Interbrigade Square. However, this is an intentionally false and misleading interpretation of the terms of the agreement (full text available here). The monument is municipal property, belonging to city district Prague 6, and the 1993 agreement therefore does not apply to this case. The statue of Konev, erected in 1980, is not a military grave or memorial and therefore it was not protected by international treaties. The democratically elected municipal council of Prague 6 voted for the removal of the statue. Using the protocol of the Politbureau's assembly, Czech historians established that on 8-14 May 1968 Konev chaired the Soviet military delegation sent to Prague to prepare the military invasion of Czechoslovakia. Konev was also chief of the Soviet troops in East Germany during the Berlin wall crisis in 1961. In other words, the Red Army brought not only liberation, but also terror to Czech Republic, as the mayor of Prague 6, Ondřej Kolář, reminded. Kolář said that he respects the role of Konev-led forces in liberating Prague, and the sacrifice of Soviet armies liberating Europe from Nazism. \"We will strive for an art competition for a memorial to the liberators of Prague at the end of World War Two instead of the marshal Konev statue,\" he said before the vote. \"At the same time we will secure a dignified - and let me stress that, dignified - placement of this art piece (Konev) in a memorial institution. I think this is a consensual solution we have called for a number of years.\" The removal of the statue was planned for April 2020 in advance and is not due to coronavirus quarantine. The monument to Marshall Konev was erected in 1980 during the \"normalisation\" period in communist Czechoslovakia. The leadership of Prague's Municipal District 6, which retains legal ownership of the statue, has voted to move the monument to a museum and replace it with a memorial commemorating Soviet sacrifices in the fight against Hitler in general, and the liberation of Prague in particular.

According to this policy, the Russian official historiography is the only “true” way of interpretation of historical events for the countries of Eastern and Central Europe.The recent statements of President Duda and President Zelenskyy regarding WWII history are based on historical facts, shared by the majority of historians. First of all, it is a historical fact that both Nazi Germany and the Stalinist USSR were harsh totalitarian regimes, which directly caused the deaths of tens of millions of people. Secondly, these two regimes are mutually responsible for the outbreak of WWII. It is also a historical fact that the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact contained the Secret Supplementary Protocol, which assumed the division of Poland and other Eastern European countries between the USSR and Germany. Thus, the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact enabled the German and Soviet military aggression against Poland in September 1939, which resulted in the occupation of this country by Germany and USSR, triggering the beginning of WWII.Read similar examples of the Russian historical revisionism concerning Poland - It is thanks to Russia that Poland today exists as a country, Nazi Germany considered Poland its best ally, USSR was forced and reluctant to sign Molotov-Ribbentrop pact and the Polish legions of Pilsudski organized the Volyn tragedy.

We cannot say that the soldiers fallen in the fight with Hitler died in order to establish Communism in Poland. The refusal to accept the fact that the Red Army soldiers liberated Poland from the German occupation is the denial of history, which is immoral.",
    "response": "This message is part of the Kremlin’s policy of historical revisionism – Russia keeps denying the fact of military and political occupation of Poland by the USSR at the end of WWII (switching the responsibility for this situation on Roosevelt and Churchill).The claim that the Soviet authorities did not plan to occupy Poland in the moment of the Red Army’s entering into this country goes against historical facts. First of all, immediately after the entering of the Red Army on the present-day territory of Poland (July 1944), the Soviet authorities established the so-called Polish Committee of National Liberation (PKWN), which was formed of Polish communists and appeared under full control of the USSR. In December 1944, this Committee was turned into the Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland, which started to be perceived by the USSR as legitimate Polish authorities since January 1945. In this way, at the very beginning of Red Army’s entrance to Poland, the USSR established its own “puppet” authorities, which became the Government of Communist Poland.During the Tehran Conference in November-December 1943, there was no talk about the post-war political fate of Poland – the USSR, UK, and US discussed only the changes in the eastern and western borders of post-war Poland.By the beginning of the Yalta Conference (February 1945), the USSR had control over a significant part of Polish territory, including Warsaw. Also, it had formally recognized its “puppet” Provisional Government as the legitimate Polish authorities. In this situation, the USSR presented their control over Poland to the Western allies as an accomplished fact. The USSR obliged to organize free elections in Poland after the end of WWII, but this obligation was never realized. De facto, Poland appeared under the Soviet military occupation until 1989.See other examples referring to the Soviet occupation of Poland - It is thanks to Russia that Poland today exists as a country and the Red Army liberated Poland and preserved the country’s economic power.

    "response": "This is a recurring disinformation narrative about the statue of Marshall Konev in Prague. It is also consistent with common pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about Russophobia and the supposedly hostile anti-Russian intentions of the West, based on which Russia can cast itself as the victim. It is also consistent with Russia's accusation to the EU and the West of trying to rewrite the history of WWII and undermine the role of the Soviet Army in defeating Nazism. The removal of the statue has nothing to do with denying the role and the sacrifices of Soviet soldiers in defeating Nazism.The mayor of the Prague 6 district that owns the statue, Ondřej Kolář said that he respects the role of Konev-led forces in liberating Prague, and the sacrifice of Soviet armies liberating Europe from Nazism. \"We will strive for an art competition for a memorial to the liberators of Prague at the end of World War Two instead of the marshal Konev statue,\" he said before the vote to remove the statue. \"At the same time, we will secure a dignified - and let me stress that dignified - placement of this art piece (Konev) in a memorial institution. I think this is a consensual solution we have called for a number of years.\"The monument to Marshall Konev was erected in 1980 during the \"normalisation\" period in communist Czechoslovakia. The leadership of Prague's Municipal District 6, which retains legal ownership of the statue, has voted to move the monument to a museum and replace it with a memorial commemorating Soviet sacrifices in the fight against Hitler in general, and the liberation of Prague in particular. More information is available here.The democratically elected municipal council of Prague 6 voted for the removal of the statue. Based on the protocol of the Politbureau's assembly, Czech historians established that on 8-14 May 1968, Konev chaired the Soviet military delegation sent to Prague to prepare the military invasion of Czechoslovakia. Konev was also chief of the Soviet troops in East Germany during the Berlin wall crisis in 1961. In other words, the Red Army brought not only liberation but also the terror to Czechia, as Kolář reminded.Read similar cases here.",

According to the statements of the Polish MFA, Poland respects the sacrifice of the Soviet soldiers in the fight with Nazism, but in 1945, Stalin's regime brought to Poland terror and atrocities. The Red Army liberated Warsaw from Nazi occupation but it didn’t mean liberty for Poland as the Soviet Army stayed in Poland for 48 years, which resulted in decades of communist oppression.According to mainstream Polish historians and views of the predominant part of Polish society, in 1944-1945, the USSR occupied Poland, establishing the undemocratic and repressive Communist Poland. De facto, Poland appeared under the Soviet military occupation until 1989, while the Russian troops were withdrawn from Poland only in 1993.See other examples referring to the Soviet occupation of Poland - It is thanks to Russia that Poland today exists as a country and the Red Army liberated Poland and preserved the country’s economic power.

    "response": "Recurrent pro-Kremlin historical revisionism about WWII and its implications on today’s world.The assertion that Russia is currently the only European country embodying a humanist attitude inevitably recalls the famous verse by Vladimir Mayakovsky about Lenin: 'the most humane human being' (as found on page 183 in either the original Russian or its English translation). Considering the human rights situation in the USSR, this quote was frequently interpreted with irony.Russia has never ‘beaten’ the Third Reich nor given independence to more than ten European countries. Russia, in 1939, was a Republic within the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union invaded and occupied Poland and Finland in 1939 and the Baltic States in 1940. On 22 June 1941, the Soviet Union started to fight against Nazi Germany alongside the allies. The Soviet Union won the war against Germany only as a member of an Alliance and the participation in the alliance cannot be separated from that of the USSR, nor can it be disregarded. Western economic aid and equipment deliveries at very favourable conditions under the framework of the Lend Lease were a determining factor. This factor was even acknowledged by Joseph Stalin. Additionally, within the Soviet Union, the contributions of other republics, especially Ukraine, were critical to the victory over Nazi Germany. This victory was a collective achievement of the Soviet Union, not solely of Russia, though the narrative emphasising Russia's role has become more prevalent in the Russian infosphere after 2014. It is important to remember the vital contributions of non-Russian nationalities within the Red Army, as well as the military and non-military support provided by the Allies. Freedom House categorises Russia as a 'consolidated authoritarian regime' and labels it 'Not Free,' noting a year-to-year decline in its freedom scores. Similarly, the Fraser Institute ranks Russia near the bottom in Europe in terms of freedom, with only Belarus scoring lower. The UN's Special Rapporteur for Russia, Mariana Katzarova, reported in 2023 a significant deterioration in human rights within the country. Additionally, numerous reports from human rights defense organizations provide detailed insights into the current human rights standards in the Russian Federation, further highlighting the challenges in this area: Gulagu.net, Zona.Media, Memorial, Human Right Watch, Amnesty International.Read also related stories such as: Russia wages war humanely and does not hit civilians, In September 1939 the USSR did not attack Poland, but carried out the liberation campaign of the Red Army, The EU is Hitler's 'New Europe', its goal is to colonise Russia and Eurasian space, In 1941 Hitler's Germany together with the EU attacked the Soviet Union.

Moreover, the first king of Belgium, Leopold Georges Chretien Frederic de Saxe-Cobourg-Saalfeld, spoke Russian language, therefore Russia is fully involved here.",

The Russian Empire's position at the time was to suppress the rise of nations in Europe, particularly the Belgian independence movement, only the uprising in Poland prevented Russia from intervening against the process that led to the creation of Belgium. Hereafter is the debunk published by Politico.\"Unsurprisingly, given Putin’s track record, the truth is almost exactly the reverse.When Belgium rose in revolution against the Kingdom of the Netherlands in pursuit of independence in 1830, Russia was fully on the side of the Dutch and was planning to send troops to crush the Belgian rebels, fearing any kind of action against Europe’s great monarchies.The Czar ultimately had to change his plans for those troops — many of them Polish — because of the November Uprising in Poland. After that was defeated, fleeing Polish officers headed to Belgium where they strengthened the country’s fledgling armed forces.While Russia ultimately accepted Belgian statehood at the London Conference of 1830, it would make more sense to credit the anti-Russian Polish revolutionaries of 1830 than the Russians for the country’s existence. Britain and France were seen as the leading powers at the conference.\" As historian Jonathan Piron points out, even if most people in Belgium took Vladimir Putin's remarks as a joke, this is historical revisionism that serves a political goal.Read also related cases such as: Lenin created Finland, or Ukraine was created by Russia, it is historically fair that it becomes Russian again, or Ukraine's statehood is myth, its territory belongs to Russia, or It was Lenin who created Ukraine , or Ukraine was created by Lenin, Stalin, and Khrushchev.

The history of Ukraine dates back to the era of the Kyivan Rus’ in the 9th-13th centuries. A fully independent Ukraine only emerged in the 20th century, after long periods of successive domination by Poland-Lithuania, Russia, and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR).In the aftermath of World War I and the disintegration of the Russian and Austro-Hungarian Empires two states were created: the Ukrainian People's Republic (UNR) and the West Ukrainian People's Republic. They merged into a unified state - the Ukrainian People's Republic - on 22 January 1919. Under Lenin's leadership at the beginning of the 20th century, Ukraine was occupied by the Bolsheviks and for decades was under communist control.Under Lenin's leadership at the beginning of the 20th century, Ukraine was occupied by the Bolsheviks and for decades was under communist control.

With the dissolution of the USSR in December 1991, Ukraine gained full independence which was also recognised by Russia under late president Yeltsin of the Russian Federation.The \"all-Russian big nation\" is an imperial Russian and Russian revanchist ideology that is a favoured pro-Kremlin narrative aimed at weakening the national identity of Ukrainians, as well as undermining the state sovereignty.Ukraine is a sovereign and independent state with a democratically-elected president and parliament. Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are respected by almost the whole world with Russia as the key exception.Pro-Kremlin media outlets often cast doubts on Ukrainian statehood and claim that Ukraine either does not exist as a state or is going to tumble down very soon, or it is a colony of the West.Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity have been violated by continuous acts of aggression by Russian armed forces since 2014 and culminated in an aggressive full-scale attack on a neighbouring country on February 24, 2022.

This rhetoric is an accusation in a mirror.The Second World War has a special place in the Kremlin’s information manipulation playbook. Invoking the ‘Great Patriotic War’ and depicting Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine as a continuation of the struggle against Nazism is a powerful rallying cry to mobilise support for Putin.Accusations of Fascism and aggression made against the so-called \"West\" can be considered as accusations in a mirror. Indeed the nature of today’s authority in the Kremlin has been qualified as Fascist by reputed Historians taking Umberto Eco criteria for Eternal Fascism. Moreover, Russia initiated the escalation in the conflict. Russia launched an experimental ballistic missile on Ukrainian city of Dnipro on 21 November 2024. This followed the attack by Ukraine of a military ammunition storage in Bryansk region and a Command post of Russian & North Korean armies in the Kursk region.The mobilisation of North Korean soldiers and officers in the conflict against Ukraine, the use of North Korean and Iranian weapons, the use of ballistic vectors designed for nuclear strikes are steps that significantly escalate, while the strikes on ammunition storage and command post cannot justify the use of an experimental Ballistic missile that would allegedly protect the population against bombing and terrorism. \"They are playing a nuclear gamble,\" the EU foreign affairs spokesman Peter Stano said of Moscow. \"Whether they really mean it, it's very hard to foresee. We don't see in their heads. We only know that this is irresponsible, and this constitutes a global threat\".A broad coalition of more than 50 nations, including the US and other NATO countries, are supporting Ukraine militarily and economically while not directly engaging in combat.

These materials include documents about the executions of the Poles and the falsification of the “Katyn case” by the German special services. The documents present the testimonies of the eyewitnesses who claimed to know about the Nazi executions of Polish soldiers – there was no Soviet involvement in the murder of Polish soldiers and officers.The indisputable historical documents show that the USSR and Russia do not have to apologise to Poland for anything.Today, the Russian investigation fully destroys the liberal lie not only about the Katyn case but also the entire history of XXth century Russia.",
    "response": "This message is part of the Kremlin’s policy of historical revisionism and an attempt to distort the truth about the Soviet crimes committed against Poland.Explicit claims that the USSR had no connection to the Katyn Massacre, made by pro-Kremlin media outlets and Russian officials, mark a direct return to the Stalinist version of history (the Katyn Lie).The Katyń Massacre is a symbol of the criminal policy of the USSR against the Polish nation. In Spring 1940, almost 22.000 Polish prisoners of war were executed by the NKVD in Katyn, Kharkiv and Kalinin (Tver). The Massacre was carefully considered and organised by the Soviet leadership. Up until 1991, the Soviet authorities refused to accept responsibility for this crime, blaming Nazi Germany for the mass-murders of Polish prisoners of war. In 1992, Russian President Boris Yeltsin submitted official documents confirming the Soviet responsibility for this crime to Polish President Lech Walesa. Read more about the Katyń Massacre here.Throughout 2020, the Russian authorities took several measures regarding the Katyń Massacre, which may be considered as historical revisionism. In May 2020, the municipal authorities of the city of Tver ordered the removal of two plaques commemorating the memory of the victims of the Katyń Massacre. In November 2020, the Russian authorities organised a conference on the Katyń Massacre – several participants of the conference promoted the idea that the USSR and the NKVD were not responsible for this crime. These statements are an evident example of historical revisionism promoted by Russia – the Polish authorities continue to demand an investigation into this Soviet crime against the Polish nation.The Polish Institute of Historical Remembrance protested against the Russian attempts to distort the truth about Soviet crimes.See other disinformation messages connected to the Kremlin’s historical revisionism: Poland re-writes the history claiming that the USSR attacked it in September 1939; Accusing USSR of WWII outbreak, Poland distracts attention from its pre-war “miscalculations” and The pre-war Polish leadership bears all the blame for the tragedy of this country during WWII.

The main point of this hastily concocted decision is to eliminate the leader of one of France’s largest parties in the run-up to the 2027 presidential election. The Fifth French Republic has finally discredited itself. The people of this country, judging by everything, should think about the institution of the Sixth Republic. And if not comes out, then can be recall great date - March 31, 1814, when the Russian army of Alexander I at the head of the Allied troops solemnly entered Paris and offered freedom. Tsarist Russia in a direct sense brought then on the bayonets democracy to France. Glorious experience! Marine Le Pen has only to wait for the Cossacks of the Russian Federation.",
    "response": "This is a recurring pro-Kremlin narrative aiming to undermine democracy and cast doubt on the functioning of democratic institutions in Europe, aiming at undermining confidence in Western democracies using intimidation and historical revisionism.This claims is made in the context of the verdict in a court case in France involving Marine Le Pen. On 31 March 2025, she was banned from running for political office in France for five years after being found guilty of embezzling European Union funds.The case involves the misuse of European Parliament funds for party staff, which has been subject to legal scrutiny. The judiciary's independence is a cornerstone of French democracy, and such cases are decided based on legal merit rather than political agendas. The judicial process adhered strictly to the rule of law, and the verdict was the result of a thorough investigation and trial, with Le Pen and her associates given full rights to defence. Moreover, there are still two levels of appeal that remain available to the defendants.In 1814 the Tsarist Empire of Alexander I could not be called a democracy but a tyranny where serfdom was the rule. The French empire was not either a democracy, but was ruled by an unified code and a constitution, one important step in the construction of rule of law in France.Today alike it cannot be considered that Russia can bring Freedom and Democracy in France since the standards are very different. Freedom House compares countries: Russia is labelled as a non-free country with a score of 4 for Political Rights and 8 for Civil Liberties making a total of 12/100.

It is also the day when all countries, except Russia, commemorate the surrender of Nazi Germany.The objective of the change was to focus on remembrance and reconciliation aligning with broader European practices. The objective is to honour all victims of World War II, dismantle Soviet-era myths, and promote reflection and remembrance rather than \"celebratory\" militarism. Ukraine’s approach aims to foster honest dialogue about the tragedies of the war, seeks to heal historical wounds, and acknowledges the experiences of diverse peoples who fought against Nazism, including stateless peoples like Jews and Ukrainians. The red poppy has been adopted as the symbol of remembrance, under the slogan: \"1939–1945. We remember. We win.\"The assertions that there is a 'Nazi resurgence in Europe' and that there is 'a lack of a unified European will to confront it' are baseless propaganda claims, which aim to discredit the EU and its policies towards Russia. The EU consistently condemns Nazism and all forms of totalitarianism. The European Union was created in the aftermath of the Second World War, and European integration has been the foundation of peace and stability on the European continent for over 70 years. The founding fathers of the European Union actively fought against Nazi Germany, with many losing their lives to free Europe from the horrors of Nazism.The EU condemns racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance, including antisemitism, which is why it has adopted numerous pieces of legislation to combat these crimes and discrimination, including: the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the EU Framework Decision on combating certain forms and expressions of racism and xenophobia by means of criminal law.Read similar cases in our database claiming that the European Union wants to openly revive the ideology of Nazism, that the European Union is openly seeking to revive Nazism, that Kaja Kallas promotes Nazism by prohibiting EU leaders from attending the Victory Parade in Moscow, that Nazi Germans exclude Russians from Victory Day celebrations, the EU glorifies Nazism or that the European Union justifies Nazism.

    "response": "Pro-Kremlin disinformation about alleged Nazism in Ukraine and the Baltic states. This claim is part of a disinformation campaign aiming to justify Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.Pro-Kremlin disinformation media repeatedly talk about the “revival” of Nazism in the West and large-scale historical revisionism used for anti-Russian goals.The myth of ‘Nazi Ukraine’ has been widely used by Putin and pro-Kremlin outlets since Russia attacked Ukraine and illegally annexed Crimea in 2014. The myth of Nazi-ruled Ukraine appeared during the Euromaidan popular protests in late 2013 - early 2014, falsely presented by pro-Kremlin disinformation as a coup. The Kremlin has been using this myth since then to discredit Ukraine’s shift towards Euro-Atlantic policy.The Baltic states and Ukraine are neither Russophobic nor neo-Nazist, but these countries have clear security concerns linked to Russia. The source of concern is Russia's aggression toward neighbouring countries and how it affected the security situation in the region in general.Notably, to mobilise domestic Russian audiences, the pro-Kremlin media repeatedly invokes WW2 imagery and attempts to portray the West as anti-Semitic and neo-fascist. See our article Anti-Semitism and pro-Kremlin disinformation.This article also clearly disregards the Soviet occupation of the Baltic states in 1940. The Kremlin conducted a forced annexation of the Baltic states in June 1940 following Soviet military occupation and the forced installation of “people’s governments”. On 23 August 1939, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed a non-aggression (Molotov-Ribbentrop) Pact whose secret protocols divided the territories belonging to Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Finland, and Romania into Soviet and Nazi spheres of influence. The Baltic States were not the beneficiaries of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact. Like other countries mentioned in the pact, they lost their independence and territories, while giving Stalin a free hand in the Baltic states.Read our articles on the 7 myths of pro-Kremlin disinformation about the Russian military build-up near Ukraine, and how the Kremlin fabricated pretexts for the further invasion of Ukraine, as well as, the narrative of ‘Nazis’ being one of the key pro-Kremlin disinformation messages.

    "summary": "Following the 2014 coup and finding itself under complete control of the West, Ukraine started disrupting all economic ties with Russia as was ordered by the West. In accordance with the Association Agreement with the EU, Ukraine opened its markets for the EU products but faced EU’s closed markets or minimal import quotas. As a result, many Ukrainian branches of the economy started stagnating. After the 2014 coup, Ukraine essentially ended being a state and turned into a former country. Historically Ukrainian territories were part of Rus’, then Russian empire, and then USSR, which is a big Russia. Since 2014 the West, a global Russian enemy succeeded in reformatting Russia’s former part, non-country Ukraine, into Anti-Russia. In a new Anti-Russian Banderstadt, less than 2 percent of the population, which holds Nazi and neo-fascist views, keeps under control the rest of the population, zombieing them with Russophobia and pushing for war with Russia. Even Volodymyr Zelenskyy cannot deal with them. In other words, Ukraine has turned into a weapon of the vicious enemy and a hostile arena towards Russia and all Russian people. The Anti-Russia existence close to Russia’s borders is wrong and strategically harmful for Russia. Russia will not tolerate it and, sooner or later, this hostile springboard will be destroyed. Russians of Novorossiya, Malorossiya (‘Little Russia’), and other historic regions will not leave to Russophobic Ukraine any territories.",
    "response": "This publication contains a nearly complete collection of most popular anti-Ukrainian pro-Kremlin propagandistic claims about Ukraine under external control, the Nazis/Fascists in Ukraine, coup d'etat in Ukraine, West-staged colour revolutions, and West's attempts to tear Ukraine apart from Russia and to make it anti-Russian. It also repeats recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives undermining the statehood of Ukraine and misrepresenting EU relations with Ukraine, and paints the war in Donbas as a result of Ukraine's aggressive actions, thus disregarding the actual sequence of events and extensive factual evidence confirming ongoing Russian military presence in Donbas. Ukraine is recognised in international law as a sovereign nation-state, with its own flag, nationality, language and with a democratically-elected president and parliament. The claims that Ukraine is under complete Western control is groundless. The US and the European Union continue to support Ukraine, its territorial integrity, and sovereignty against Russian aggression. The Ukrainian Statistical Service informs that the EU accounts for 43% of Ukrainian exports. In 2017, Ukraine exported 17.5 bln USD worth of goods to the EU. The negative trade balance decreased from 10 bln USD to 3 bln USD. See here for further information about the DCFTA and the cooperation between the EU and Ukraine. Ukraine is the largest recipient of the EU’s macro-financial aid among all non-EU countries. There was no coup d’état in Ukraine in 2014. The spontaneous onset of the Euromaidan protests was a reaction by numerous segments of the Ukrainian population to former President Yanukovych’s violent dispersal of peaceful student protests against Yanukovych's sudden decision to withdraw from the Association Agreement with the European Union in November 2013. See the full debunk here. The publication also uses a derogatory term Malorossiya ('Little Russia') which derives from imperial Russian and Russian irredentist ideology that is a favoured pro-Kremlin narrative aimed at weakening the national identity of Ukrainians and undermining Ukraine's sovereignty. It also mentions Novorossiya. Read our stories about anti-Ukrainian propaganda Ukraine Under Information Fire and Five Years of Falsehoods: Was it Worth the While for the Kremlin? as well as earlier disinformation cases claiming that Ukraine was ruled by the Nazis, that US State Department is Gauleiter’s structure over Ukraine, that Ukraine started the war in Donbas, and that the EU has turned away from Ukraine.

See similar cases on the Baltic states and the Soviet occupation here and here. The claim that Estonia could not have been occupied by the USSR unless it was an ally of Nazi Germany is illogical. As a result of WWII, the USSR de facto occupied not only former German allies such as Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary, but also several countries, which were neutral (Baltic states) or faced direct German aggression (Poland, Czechoslovakia). On the 23rd of August, 1939, Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed a non-aggression (Molotov-Ribbentrop) pact, whose secret protocols divided the territories belonging to Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Finland, and Romania into Soviet and Nazi spheres of influence. Contrary to the claims of the pro-Kremlin media, the re-capturing of the Baltic States did not bring freedom, but Soviet repressions and occupation, which lasted for 50 years.

The claim that the Soviet attack on Poland did not have any significant effects on the course of the war for Poland is a cynical attempt to downplay the historical importance of the Soviet participation in the partition of Poland realised together with Nazi Germany. On August 23, 1939, Nazi Germany and the USSR signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact with a Secret Supplementary Protocol, which divided Poland and other Eastern European countries between these two totalitarian powers.

The accusations that the UK had “expansionist plans” in Europe and attempted to provoke a war between Germany and the USSR is clear historical manipulation and these events are not confirmed by historical documents and historians. In terms of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, it is a proven historical fact that it contained the Secret Supplementary Protocol, which assumed the division of Poland and other Eastern European countries between the USSR and Germany. Thus, the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact directly caused the German and Soviet military aggression against Poland in September 1939, which resulted in complete occupation of this country by Germany and USSR. See similar examples of Russian historical revisionism concerning Poland here and here. Russia signed Molotv-Ribbentrop pact because it was threatened by Germany. Today Russia is threatened by Poland. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact did not violate the rights of the Polish state USSR was forced and reluctant to sign Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact It is thanks to Russia that Poland today exists as a country Nazi Germany considered Poland its best ally",

    "title": "Soviet occupation is a myth; Estonia's successes came in USSR",
    "summary": "The main purpose of all this talk of \"occupation\" is to construct a nationally-forming model of history.\"But the trouble is that any person who is generally interested in this topic, will immediately run into the absolute falsity of this construction. After all, it was under Soviet rule that the dawn of industry, economy, education, medicine and culture was. Estonia is not present in many spheres of life now,\" the expert added.Estonia as a state was founded as a result of the First World War and the Civil War in Russia, so there could be no talk of any achievements: no one, of course, built any luxurious prosperous life, and all the successes of Estonia were already associated with it being a part of the USSR.It is known that the active fanning of the myth of the \"Soviet occupation\" began in Estonia after independence in 1991. According to the official version of Tallinn, both the voluntary annexation of Estonia to the USSR in 1940 and the liberation of its territory from the fascist invaders in 1944 should be considered \"occupation\".We do not accept the very concept of \"Soviet occupation\" through which they are trying to interpret the liberation of European peoples from fascist enslavement in a similar vein.",
    "response": "Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the Baltic States. The Soviet occupation is not a myth. On the 23rd of August, 1939, Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed a non-aggression (Molotov-Ribbentrop) pact, whose secret protocols divided the territories belonging to Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Finland and Romania into Soviet and Nazi spheres of influence. Shortly after the pact was signed, Poland was invaded by Nazi Germany on 1 September and by Soviets on 17 September in 1939. Within a few weeks, the Soviet Union used threats to impose a series of “mutual assistance” treaties on the Baltic states. These treaties allowed USSR to station troops in their territories, laying the groundwork for the Soviet occupation. In June 1940, the Kremlin conducted a forced annexation of the Baltic states, following Soviet military occupation and the forced installation of “people’s governments”. \n\nIn other words, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which had been independent between the two world wars, were not incorporated into the Soviet Union in a legal way and with the consent of the elected authorities of these states.After Germany attacked the USSR in June 1941, the Baltic States were occupied by Nazi Germany until 1944 when the region reverted to Soviet control. However, on September 18, acting President-Prime Minister Jüri Uluots appointed Otto Tief`s government into office. The restoration of the governmental organs of the Republic of Estonia during the eventful September of 1944 is important, because it affirmed the juridical continuation of the Republic of Estonia, and it showed that Estonia accepted neither the Soviet occupation nor the 3-year period of German occupation.This also means that contrary to the claims of the pro-Kremlin media, the re-capturing of the Baltic States did not bring freedom, but Soviet repressions and occupation, which lasted for 50 years. It has been estimated that as many as 80,000 Estonians were deported between 1945 and 1953. More than 22 000 of them never came home, because they were murdered or died due to inhuman living conditions in imprisonment or in forced banishment. Most of them are buried in graves without names.The estimated war and occupation deaths are at 90,000 in Estonia, 180,000 in Latvia, and 250,000 in Lithuania. Furthermore, It has been estimated that between 1946 and 1953 deportations and guerrilla deaths reached 95,000 in Estonia, 125,000 in Latvia, and 310,000 in Lithuania.It should be noted that on 24 December 1989, the Parliament of the USSR, the Congress of the People’s Deputies, adopted a resolution, acknowledging the annexation of the Baltic states as a violation of the USSR's obligations. An English translation of the full text can be found here: The Congress notes that during this period the relations of the USSR with Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia were regulated by a system of treaties. Pursuant to the 1920 Peace Treaties and 1926-1933 Non-Aggression Treaties, the signatories were obliged to honour each other’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and inviolability under any circumstances. The Soviet Union had assumed similar obligations to Poland and Finland. See similar disinformation narratives on this issue - The Baltic states benefited from the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact; The Baltic states are perpetuating the myth of the Soviet occupation and The Baltic states refuse to celebrate the victory over fascism.The claim about economy and the living standard in Estonia is similar to disinformation narratives about socio-economic degradation in the Baltic States as opposed to their alleged well-being under the USSR. Suffice to say, Estonia’s GDP per capita in 1993 was 5749 dollars, while in 2019 it had increased to 38,811 dollars. The Baltic States benefited from the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact The Baltic States are perpetuating the myth of the Soviet occupation The Baltic States refuse to celebrate the victory over Fascism Young people in the Baltic States must leave because the socio-economic situation is so bad",

    "title": "Soviet troops waiting for the Warsaw Uprising to bleed out is a myth",
    "summary": "Affirmations that the Red Army waited along the shores of the Vistula river in Warsaw in 1944 while Nazi troops crushed the insurrection of Polish rebels because Stalin wanted to destroy Polish nationalist forces are a myth, as shown by newly declassified documents from Russia’s Ministry of Defence. Actually, the Soviet troops lacked the means to launch a whole offensive to liberate the city, but they managed to supply the rebels with weapons, ammunition and food. In any case, the so-called Armia Krajowa or National Army hailed as the only true heroes by the Polish government actually became armed gangs who terrorised the Polish population after the liberation.",
    "response": "This is part of a recurrent Russian narrative to portray the Red Army as liberators of Eastern Europe and not as its occupiers. The current disinformation campaign against Poland was launched in reaction to the resolution of the European Parliament in September 2019 on the importance of European remembrance for the future of Europe, expressing deep concern on the efforts of the current Russian leadership to distort historical facts and whitewash crimes committed by the Soviet totalitarian regime. This resolution was perceived by the Kremlin historians as an act of aggression. Actually, the occupation and ‘sovietisation’ of Poland and the rest of the Eastern Bloc was achieved with terror, mass repressions, nationalisation of industry, expropriation of privately owned land, environmental disasters, destruction of the market economy and restrictions of civil and political freedoms. Writing about the Warsaw Uprising, Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki clarified that “the Red Army stared on idly at the agony of Warsaw. The city’s two uprisings, the first in the Jewish ghetto in 1943, the second in the entire city in 1944, were evidence of the ruthlessness of German crimes. But while the people of Warsaw waited hopefully for help, Joseph Stalin never ordered the Red Army to intervene.” This has also been the conclusion of professional historians for the last 75 years. According to the Polish Institute of National Remembrance, the declassified documents published by Russia do not bring any significant new information on Soviet operations during 1944-1945. The institute also states that during this period, the Soviet Union, at the same time as fighting Germany, pursued a consistent policy aimed at preventing the reconstruction of the independent Republic of Poland. The Soviet documents falsely present the Polish Home Army self-defence actions against Soviet enslavement, massive repression and murders by the NKVD and other formations in the parts of Poland occupied by the USSR as \"terrorist activities\", hiding the entire Soviet policy against Poland's independence in 1944-1945. See other examples of disinformation on this topic, such as the terrorist activities of the Polish Home Army, how its supposed cooperation with Nazi forces made them rich thanks to concentration camps, the alleged lawfulness of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact or the claims that Poland and the Baltics are distorting WWII history. Soviet troops were not able to support the Warsaw Uprising The Polish economy was revived thanks to the Soviet Union The Polish Home Army carried out terrorist activities behind the backs of the Red Army Polish Home Army was cooperating with the Nazis and got rich from the concentration camps The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact did not violate the rights of the Polish state Poland and Baltic states distort the truth about WWII",

First, Great Britain and France declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939, while Soviet Union waited June 1941. It is incorrect to say that during this time Great Britain was calmly waiting on its island. The UK Army counter-attacked in different operational fields such as the Mediterranean and Middle East, including the North-African and East-African campaigns, and in the Balkans.Secondly the massive industrial, economic and military support to Soviet Union through the land-lease mechanism cannot be dismissed. The support to the USSR began after the end of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. In June 1941, within weeks of the German invasion of the USSR, the Anglo-Soviet Agreement was made and the first British aid convoy set off along the dangerous Arctic Sea route to Murmansk, arriving in September.

The Russian control over the Peninsula did not bring the local population any “peace and prosperity”. Immediately after the Russian takeover, the local peoples living in Crimea (Crimean Tatars, Karaims, Greeks, Armenians, etc.) faced large-scale deportations. Throughout the XVIII and XIX centuries, at least 400.000 Crimean Tatars were forced to leave Crimea, moving to present-day Turkey. In a similar way, the local Karaims and Greeks were resettled to other parts of the Russian Empire.As a result of these massive deportations and migration, Moscow managed to increase the number of ethnic Russians living in Crimea (who had never lived in this area before the XIX century). Moscow managed to establish a relative majority of ethnic Russians living in Crimea only after the genocidal 1944 deportation of all the Crimean Tatars living in this region.This article acknowledges the fact that Russian control over Crimea was established only 240 years ago – yet claims that Crimea “has always been Russian” and is “Russian ancestral land”.

Both Nazi Germany and the Stalinist USSR were harsh totalitarian regimes, which directly caused the deaths of tens of millions of people. Secondly, these two regimes are mutually responsible for the outbreak of WWII.It is a fact that the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact contained the Secret Supplementary Protocol, which assumed the division of Poland and other Eastern European countries between the USSR and Germany. Thus, the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact enabled the German and Soviet military aggression against Poland in September 1939, which resulted in the occupation of this country by Germany and USSR, triggering the beginning of WWII.See similar examples of the Russian accusations against Poland, Ukraine and the Baltic states in falsification and re-writing of history - Poland creates and promotes its historical myths in an active and aggressive way; Poland and Lithuania question the status of Russia as a country who won WWII; President Duda and President Zelensky promote propaganda and Poland tries to adjust history to politics, misinterpreting the historical facts.

For several hundred years, Belarus was an integral part of the I Rzeczpospolita (Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth). Only at the end of the XVIII century, the territory of Belarus came under Russian control.The official historiography of the Russian Empire and the USSR tried to justify the Russian control over Belarus and Ukraine with a message that the “true history” of these countries started only after they “were returned to Russia” at the end of the XVIII century.Claiming the undisputed history of the “Russian world” is far-fetched.

The commissar's order and the decree of martial jurisdiction were to become a carte blanche for mass murder without punishment.

Read earlier examples of \"The Great Reset\" conspiracy in the EUvsDisinfo database here and here.On 6 January 2021, during a debate in the Senate, a number of Trump supporters broke through security perimeters and violently entered the Capitol, the seat of the US parliament, the Congress. The aim of the protesters was to impede the process of formally installing Joe Biden as the President of the United States, despite Biden winning the November election. An overview of the incident can be found here.The publication falsely claims about Donald Trump's electoral victory. President-elect Joe Biden, who was a candidate of the Democratic Party, won the popular vote by 7 million votes.

The Soviet state took away livestock, crops and seeds from the peasants under the guise that they \"plundered\" state property. The Soviet law on the seizure of food from peasants was adopted in 1932 and is known as the \"Five Spikelet Law\". Anyone who gathered several ears of wheat on the collective farm field was a culprit of \"theft of state property\". The punishment for theft of kolkhoz or cooperative property was the death sentence. This law was personally attributed to Joseph Stalin. The famine of 1932-1933 claimed the lives of 7 to 10 million citizens of the Soviet Union; the disaster affected in large parts but not only Ukraine but also parts of Belarus, Kazakhstan, Moldova and Russia. As Ukraine was particularly dominated by agriculture, Stalin entrusted Lazar Kaganovich to force through the orders in against Ukrainian peasents. The Holodomor is well documented and confirmed by a huge array of declassified documents, including official documents of the Soviet authorities and the Communist Party. In 2006, the Verkhovna Rada officially recognised the Holodomor of 1932-33 as a genocide of the Ukrainian people. According to the latest data, 15 UN member states and the Vatican state recognise the Holodomor as an act of genocide in Ukraine. The European Parliament and PACE have recognised the Holodomor as a crime of the Soviet regime against their own people and a crime against humanity.

The Council of Europe is not indifferent to discrimination of ethinc minorities in Europe. The European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI), the human rights monitoring body under the Council of Europe monitors the situation and issues recommendations to the member states, including Russia. For example, in 2014, the ECRI expressed grave concern at serious allegations of intimidation and discrimination against Ukrainian speakers and Tatars in the Crimean region of Ukraine, under the de facto control of the Russian Federation.The Ukrainian Law on ensuring the functioning of the Ukrainian language as a state language, passed in 2019, establishes mandatory use of the Ukrainian language in most areas of public and communal life, including the mass media, education, science, etc.However, it is not directed against any minority. The law does not forbid the use of Russian nor other languages in private communication and religious ceremonies. Moreover, Russian and other languages can be present in book publishing, the press, including radio and television, education and the service sector. The law allows the use of other languages in the healthcare system and in law enforcement.From 16 January 2021, according to the law, the public services sector must provide services in Ukrainian, unless a consumer asks to speak in Russian, English or other languages.Furthermore, Ukraine and Baltic states are signatories to the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. As enshrined in the Convention, people in Ukraine and the Baltic states have the right: \"to use freely and without interference his or her minority language, in private and in public, orally and in writing\".The accusation that Ukraine and the Baltic states are “falsifying and re-writing” is another recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative. The official position of Ukraine and the Baltic states regarding WWII is based on facts, shared by the predominant majority of historians. Both Nazi Germany and the Stalinist USSR were harsh totalitarian regimes, which directly caused the deaths of tens of millions of people. Secondly, these two regimes are mutually responsible for the outbreak of WWII.See similar cases alleging that the Baltic states, Ukraine and Poland revise history for political revenge against Russia, or that Ukrainisation is about political terror and Russophobia in Ukraine.

    "summary": "By these cynical actions [“public desecration of symbols of Russian military glory” after the statue of a Soviet marshal was unbolted last week in Prague] the Prague municipal authorities have seriously breached the obligations contracted by the Czech Republic. A Czech-Russian treaty of 1993 obliges the Czech Republic to take care of Russian military monuments on its territory. The Committee also denounces the “contempt for the common memory and the history of the struggle of the Soviet people against fascism” on the part of those who had the statue removed. This is an act of vandalism, mockery and violation of all international obligations of the Czech Republic.",
    "response": "This is a recurring disinformation narrative about the statue of Marshall Konev in Prague, seeking to obfuscate the statue's legal status and the grounds for its removal. In the dispute over the statue, Russia has argued that under the Czech-Russian mutual agreement of 1993, Czechia is obliged to leave the statue in place on Prague's Interbrigade Square. However, this is an intentionally false and misleading interpretation of the terms of the agreement (full text available here). The monument is municipal property, belonging to city district Prague 6, and the 1993 agreement therefore does not apply to this case. The statue of Konev, erected in 1980, is not a military grave or memorial and therefore it was not protected by international treaties. The democratically elected municipal council of Prague 6 voted for the removal of the statue. Using the protocol of the Politbureau's assembly, Czech historians established that on 8-14 May 1968 Konev chaired the Soviet military delegation sent to Prague to prepare the military invasion of Czechoslovakia. Konev was also chief of the Soviet troops in East Germany during the Berlin wall crisis in 1961. In other words, the Red Army brought not only liberation, but also terror to Czech Republic, as the mayor of Prague 6, Ondřej Kolář, reminded. Kolář said that he respects the role of Konev-led forces in liberating Prague, and the sacrifice of Soviet armies liberating Europe from Nazism. \"We will strive for an art competition for a memorial to the liberators of Prague at the end of World War Two instead of the marshal Konev statue,\" he said before the vote. \"At the same time we will secure a dignified - and let me stress that, dignified - placement of this art piece (Konev) in a memorial institution. I think this is a consensual solution we have called for a number of years.\". The removal of the statue was planned for April 2020 in advance and is not due to coronavirus quarantine. The monument to Marshall Konev was erected in 1980 during the \"normalisation\" period in communist Czechoslovakia. The leadership of Prague's Municipal District 6, which retains legal ownership of the statue, has voted to move the monument to a museum and replace it with a memorial commemorating Soviet sacrifices in the fight against Hitler in general, and the liberation of Prague in particular.

    "summary": "The annual commemoration of the Allied landings in Normandy is a classic example of hybrid warfare in the form of historical revisionism. The landings in Normandy in 1944 were a military operation by the British Empire, supported by the American expeditionary force. The idea that the defeat of Nazi Germany began with Normandy is an utter lie. Moreover, the French people did not welcome their liberators. In reality, it is clear that the liberation of Europe did not start with the Normandy landings as the course of the war was already clear after the huge tank battle at Kursk between the Germans and the Russians in 1943.",
    "response": "A disinformation narrative that presents a distorted version of the history of the Normandy landings that began on 6 June 1944. This case is part of a wider and systematic campaign of historical revisionism, particularly of the Second World War, by pro-Kremlin media.The history of who defeated Nazi-Germany is not like a 'beauty-contest'. It was a joint effort and no serious voice diminishes the contribution by the Soviet Union. In the same context, both the battles of Kursk in 1943 and that of Normandy in 1944 were key to the defeat of Nazi Germany. Records show that a few months after the battle of Kursk, at the Tehran Conference, Stalin stated that the USSR would not have been able to fight off Germany without the Land Lease Act enacted by the US in 1941. His successor, Nikita Khrushchev, was of the same opinion. Through the Land Lease Act, the US provided the USSR with the contemporary equivalent of $180 billion, hundreds of thousands of military and logistical vehicles, such as trucks, airplanes and tanks, and millions of tons of important resources, including food, petrol, clothing material and other resources. US military, economic and manufacturing capabilities were also instrumental to the success of the Normandy landings, which were conducted under a fully bi-national Anglo-American chain of command.It is not true that French civilians did not welcome the forces of the Western Allies in 1944. Importantly, a French division, armed with American equipment, partook in the operation to liberate France that began with the Normandy landings. As American and French troops entered Paris in August 1944, they were met with exuberant celebrations by French civilians. As one eye witness account records: “Men and women cried with joy. They grabbed the arms and hands of soldiers and cheered until their voices were hoarse.”Similar cases of historical revisionism in our database include the claims that the British are not happy with the outcome of WW2, because they planned to profit from Russian territories, that Western democracies are primarily responsible for the Second World War, that the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact did not pave the way for the outbreak of the Second World War, and that only the activeness of Jews in America prevents the European Parliament from blaming Jews for WW2.

    "response": "During the WWII, ‘armies of Europe’ did not invade the USSR. It was the Axis powers, opposed by the Allied powers headed by France, the UK, the US and the USSR. Some European countries had been forced by Nazi Germany to join the Axis powers, but then, after capitulation to the Soviet army, supported the Allied powers. Poland was seized and then divided by Hitler and Stalin in 1939 and then, after WWII, occupied by the USSR as were large parts of Eastern Europe. The EU was established after WWII.

The initiative to establish this Day of Remembrance comes from the Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism signed in 2008 by over 50 European politicians and prominent political prisoners and dissidents. This Remembrance Day is aimed at the promotion of historical remembrance about WWII and condemnation of totalitarian ideologies.Both Nazi Germany and the Stalinist USSR were harsh totalitarian regimes, which directly caused the deaths of tens of millions of people.Nazi Germany started the WWII attacking Poland on September 1, 1939, with Soviet troops entering Polish territory on September 17.By the early part of 1939 Hitler had become determined to invade and occupy Poland. Secret negotiations between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union led to the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in Moscow on August 23–24. In a secret protocol of this pact, the Germans and the Soviets agreed that Poland should be divided between them, with the Western part of the country going to Germany and the eastern two-thirds being taken over by the USSR.

It reflects the Kremlin’s policy of historical revisionism and is an attempt to portray Russia's role in World War II as not aggressive. The European Parliament resolution, stressing that World War II was an immediate result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, was portrayed as “fascist” along with the Parliament which adopted it. The pro-Kremlin media outlets claimed that the European Parliament has joined forces with fascism, that it represents the Third Reich, and relieves Germany of the responsibility of World War II. The disinformation campaign about the European Parliament resolution has also targeted Poland, the Baltic States, Finland and Ukraine. The article also contains attacks against Poland, the Baltic states and Ukraine. It is not true, as the article claims, that the European Parliament resolution “blames the Soviet Union”, while “moving Hitler into the background”. The resolution states that the outbreak of the war was an immediate result of the Molotov-Ribentropp Pact, an agreement between two totalitarian regimes. It is a fact that the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact contained the Secret Supplementary Protocol, which assumed the division of Poland and other Eastern European countries between the USSR and Germany. Thus, the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact enabled the German and Soviet military aggression against Poland in September 1939, which resulted in the occupation of this country by Germany and USSR, triggering the beginning of WWII. It is also not true that the resolution suggests that Russia and Vladimir Putin are to be blamed for the Second World War. The resoultion states that “Russia remains the greatest victim of communist totalitarianism”.

    "response": "This is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative accusing the EU of Nazism and historical revisionism. The claim also advances a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative distorting the events leading up to the Second World War, in particular denying USSR responsibility for starting WWII after signing the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in 1939.These claims serve the Kremlin's broader disinformation campaign portraying contemporary Europe as morally bankrupt and historically revisionist about WWII, when in fact it is Russia that manipulates historical memory for political purposes.This disinformation claim is a reaction to HRVP Kaja Kallas's call to EU member states to refrain from travelling to Moscow to celebrate Victory Day on May 9, and instead to go to Kyiv to support Ukraine.The EU's stance on Russia is based on its illegal invasion of Ukraine, not on Nazi ideology. The EU consistently condemns Nazism and all forms of totalitarianism. The assertion that the EU is trying to 'revive European Nazi ideology' is a baseless propaganda claim aimed at discrediting the EU and its policies towards Russia. The EU's actions are focused on supporting Ukraine's sovereignty and opposing Russian aggression, not on promoting any extremist ideologies.Pro-Kremlin outlets repeatedly talk about the “revival” of Nazism in the West. Labelling Russia’s adversaries as Nazis is a widespread pro-Kremlin disinformation technique, and has been used by Russia to justify the invasion of Ukraine by portraying it as a “denazification operation”. Russia spent years preparing the information battleground before its kinetic attack, with “Nazi Ukraine” being one of its most prominent disinformation features.The EU was founded after WWII to promote peace, democracy, human rights, economic cooperation, social justice and cultural diversity. EU founding treaties emphasise economic cooperation to prevent future wars. Founders of the EU, such as Robert Schuman, Jean Monnet, and Konrad Adenauer, were all active opponents of Nazi Germany. Part of their opposition to Nazism was the EU project itself, thinking that by establishing a political and economic union between European countries, they can ensure ideologies such as Nazism never rise again.Read similar disinformation cases claiming that The European Union wants to openly revive the ideology of Nazism, that The European Union is openly seeking to revive Nazism, that The European elites want to turn the EU into the Fourth Reich, that The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and the USSR did not contribute to the start of WWII, that Warmongering EU’s Fourth Reich wants a Third World War, that The EU is taking the Third Reich’s path, that Nazi Europe's fight against Russia via Ukraine is a fight against the memory of Nazi defeat, that USSR brought freedom to Poland in 1945, that Fascism is the core value of Europe, or that The EU glorifies Nazism.

Instead, there is the usual: an adventurous flight from reality and self-congratulation.This has long been the norm for those in government in Germany. They phrase what they want, glossing over every economic decline, selling every social outrage as a necessity, and presenting military rearmament as ‘security policy’, while a huge propaganda apparatus inflates myths and lies as thick as a fist to ‘truth’.

    "response": "Historical revisionism and disinformation about the unification of Germany. The claim that the Federal Republic of Germany’s (FRG) annexed the German Democratic Republic (GDR) on October 3, 1990, is merely a twist of the narrative of Western imperialist capitalism and is a misrepresentation of historical and economic realities. This claim can be analysed and refuted:The decay of the communist regimes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union was felt by broad groups of citizens which manifested itself in protests. This triggered the downfall of the German Democratic Republic. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the first free multiparty elections took place in East Germany, where the eastern counterpart of the Christian Democratic Union won the majority of votes.A unification treaty was ratified by the Bundestag and the People’s Chamber in September and went into effect on October 3, 1990. The German Democratic Republic joined the Federal Republic as five additional Länder (federal states).While the GDR's annexation by the FRG on October 3, 1990, is often framed as a triumph, it was a challenging transition from a failing socialist system to a market economy. The GDR's economy was marked by inefficiency and stagnation, leading to its eventual collapse. The subsequent privatization efforts resulted in massive job losses—over 2.5 million by 1994—highlighting the severe economic dislocation that followed reunification. Its of importance to note the significant economic and social challenges that arose from this process.Read more about the reunification of Germany here. The economic and other differences between the Eastern and Western parts of Germany still exist, but there is no basis to claim that the Eastern part of the country was annexed by West Germany.See similar cases East Germany was attached to the West as a colony, The construction of the Berlin wall was also desired by the Western powers and NATO lies about the reasons for the fall of the Berlin Wall.

The Doctrine called on both Poland and Russia to abandon their struggle over the domination of other East European countries.

But this had been rejected one by one and the talks with Moscow had been prolonged. Since then, the events have repeatedly been used for accusations and allegations that the Soviet Union under Joseph V. Stalin had made common cause with fascist Germany under Adolf Hitler.

    "response": "A recurring disinformation narrative revising the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. This message is part of the Kremlin’s policy of historical revisionism and an attempt to portray Russia's role in World War II as non-aggressive. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact (the Treaty of Non-Aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union) was signed on 23 August 1939. Its secret protocols divided Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence. Thus, the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact directly caused the German and Soviet military aggression against Poland in September 1939, which resulted in complete occupation of the country by Germany and the USSR. The Treaty enabled the USSR to invade and annex the Baltic States. The Soviets also annexed Romania's provinces of Bessarabia (today's Moldova) and northern Bukovina (now in Ukraine) and the Czechoslovakian territory of Carpathian Ruthenia (now also part of Ukraine). Throughout the territories it occupied, the Soviet Union carried out harsh political reprisals, including mass executions and deportations. Also, the Soviet Union kept negotiating with Britain and France, but in the end, Stalin chose to reach an agreement with Germany. By doing so, he hoped to keep the USSR at peace with Germany and to gain time to build up the Soviet military establishment, which had been weakened by the purge of the Red Army officer corps in 1937. The Pact is not being used against Russia by \"the current Western front\" but rather regarded - alongside the Western policy of appeasement - as one of the direct causes of the Second World War. Although widely criticised since, the 1938 Munich agreement confined the recognition of Nazi territorial claims to Sudetenland; Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact entitled Hitler to half of Europe.

Before this, from May 1939 until August 1939, the UK, France, Poland and the USSR were trying to find a compromise to create a coalition during the so-called Moscow Negotiations. Poland categorically refused to let the Red Army into its territory, fearing Soviet occupation. The USSR started in parallel negotiations with Germany and on 23 August 1939, signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop (Stalin-Hitler) pact, in which the Soviet Union and Germany divided their \"spheres of interests\" in Europe: the division of Poland, the Baltic countries, Finland, and Romania were agreed.

Such a policy had unfortunately been pursued so far and threatened to trigger the fourth great war, despite the written offers of the Soviet Union to France and Czechoslovakia. The Soviet proposals were practically ignored. They had been accepted indifferently, if not contemptuously […] The events took place as if there had been no Soviet Russia.

The Munich Agreement (September 30, 1938), indeed, permitted German annexation of the Sudetenland, in western Czechoslovakia. The policy of appeasement towards Adolf Hitler was heavily criticised in Europe and proved to be a disastrous move. World War II began in Europe on 1 September 1939, when Germany invaded Poland. Great Britain and France responded by declaring war on Germany on 3 September. Before Germany attacked Poland, Hitler and Stalin signed a non-aggression pact, also known as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact (23 August 1939). The deal was accompanied by a secret supplementary protocol on the delimitation of areas of mutual interest in Eastern Europe. In particular, Hitler and Stalin agreed to divide Poland. The agreement also indicated that the Baltic states of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, as well as Bessarabia and Finland, belonged to the respective areas of interest of Germany and the USSR. The Soviet Union attacked Poland on September 17, forcing the Polish army to fight on two fronts. Poland was divided according to the agreements of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact. The USSR later attacked Finland and annexed the Baltic states, all along the agreements with Nazi Germany. For more similar cases see here, here and here. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact did not pave the way for the outbreak of the Second World War European Parliament falsifies history about Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact being the cause of WWII The isolated USSR had no alternative and had to sign the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact",

    "response": "This message is part of the Kremlin’s policy of historical revisionism which attempts to portray Russia's role in World War II as non-aggressive, to blame the West for the outbreak of World War II, to relativise and erode the disastrous historical role of the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact (the Treaty of Non-Aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union) by stating that other countries signed various international agreements with Adolf Hitler throughout the 1930s, and to argue that it was the Munich Agreement that triggered WWII. According to the best historical research, it was clearly the Molotov-Ribentropp Pact (Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact: A 'honeymoon' for two dictators), signed on August 23, 1939, that triggered World War II. Its secret supplementary protocols divided Eastern and Central Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence. The signing of this Pact enabled the German and Soviet military aggression against Poland in September 1939, which resulted in the occupation of this country by Germany and USSR, triggering the beginning of World War II. Moreover, it is impossibile to compare the Munich Agreement to the Ribbentropp-Molotov Pact or to establish any kind of moral equivalence between them. The Munich Agreement has always been a symbol of cowardly “appeasement policy” and a diplomatic disaster. Germany, Italy, Great Britain, and France, without inviting Czechoslovakia decided that, for the sake of peace in Europe, the Sudettenland region, which was predominantly inhabited by Germans, must be surrendered to Germany. However, the Munich Agreement was not a secret and did not mean the liquidation and division of Czechoslovakia as a state, because the British and French had the illusion that Hitler would “calm down” and the war in Europe would be prevented. When Germany itself destroyed the Munich Pact and occupied Prague in March 1939, Anglo-French policy towards Nazi Germany changed fundamentally from appeasement to resistance. By contrast, the secret protocols to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact definitely provided for the division of the territories of other countries between Germany and the USSR. The Nazi-Soviet Pact enabled the German Fuhrer Adolf Hitler and the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin to start the war by assaulting their neighbours and to create a situation where “territorial and political restructuring” occurred, followed by the wide seizure of foreign territories and the elimination of independence in neighbouring countries.

    "summary": "The “Iron Wolf” was the name of a Lithuanian fascist union, which was established in 1927 under the authoritarian rule of Antanas Smetona. The decision to call the NATO exercises taking place in Lithuania with this name is a provocation – this signal is clearly aimed against Russia. All allusions concerning the “wolf” are a reference to Adolf Hitler, as his headquarters were called Wolfschanze (Wolf’s Lair).",
    "response": "This message is a part of the Kremlin’s policy of historical revisionism – it continuously accuses the Baltic states of their support for the Nazi or Fascist ideology. Any disagreement with the official Kremlin’s view on the history of the Baltic states is automatically labelled by Russia as support for “Nazism”. The Iron Wolf is a mythical character from a medieval legend of the founding of the city of Vilnius. The name of the Iron Wolf holds one of the most important units of the Lithuanian Army - Mechanised Infantry Brigade “Iron Wolf”. A Lithuanian paramilitary organization “Iron Wolf” (“Geležinis Vilkas”) existed in 1927-1934 – it united mainly young army officers. In 1934, the followers of the “Iron Wolf” tried to implement the coup d'état against President Smetona – the coup failed, and the organization was destroyed by the Lithuanian authorities. Thus, this organization stopped to exist very quickly after Hitler came to power in Germany. The claim that “any allusions concerning the “wolf” is a reference to Adolf Hitler as his headquarters were called Wolfschanze (Wolf's Lair)” cannot be taken seriously – it is a common word used all over the world without any alleged references to Hitler. In other words, the name of NATO exercises “Iron Wolf” clearly refers to the well-known legend about the Iron Wolf, a mythical founder of the city of Vilnius (not depending on the grammar form of this name in Lithuanian – “Geležinis Vilkas” or „Geležinio Vilko”). See other cases on the Baltic states – Baltic states are perpetuating the myth of Soviet occupation; Estonian authorities paying tribute to Hitler’s Cross of Liberty; Baltic states benefited from the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.

In this case, the Polish authorities are accused of “support” to Hitler and the Third Reich because they moved the date of celebration of the Day of the Polish Armed Forces from the “Communist” date to the original pre-war date. The Day of the Polish Armed Forces (August 15) was established in 1923. It commemorates the victory of Poland over the Bolshevik troops near Warsaw in 1920. Under the Communist rule, this holiday was celebrated on October 12. Since 1992, the Day of the Polish Armed Forces is celebrated on its original pre-war date (August 15). The statement that the Polish authorities allegedly try to “absolve” Hitler and Nazis is clearly a fake propagandist statement. The manifestation of support to Nazism and other totalitarian ideologies is a criminal offence in Poland. See similar examples of the Russian accusations against Poland in falsification and re-writing of history - Poland creates and promotes its historical myths in an active and aggressive way; Poland and Lithuania question the status of Russia as a country who won WWII; President Duda and President Zelensky promote propaganda and Poland tries to adjust history to politics, misinterpreting the historical facts.

The Volyn Tragedy is a difficult mark in Polish-Ukrainian relations, and as such it is exploited by pro-Kremlin outlets, in an attempt to deepen the divisions. In the historical aspect, the statement that the “Polish Legions organized the Volyn Tragedy” is entirely ignorant. First of all, the Polish Legions existed throughout WWI (1914-1917/1918), while the Volyn Tragedy took place during WWII (1943-1944). The Polish Legions were established by Józef Piłsudski in August 1914 on the territory of Galicia - they became a formation of the Austro-Hungarian Army. Throughout 1917, the Austrian authorities disbanded the Legions as they refused to get subordinated to the German Army. After the proclamation of restoration of Poland's sovereignty (November 11, 1918), the soldiers and officers of the Polish Legions formed the core of the Polish Army. The Volyn Tragedy took place throughout 1943-1944 when tens of thousands of Poles living in Volyn and Galicia regions were murdered or expelled by the Ukrainian militia forces. The Polish historiography presents this event as an act of genocide or a series of large-scale massacres against the Poles realized by the Ukrainian nationalists. The Ukrainian historiography presents this event as two-side ethnic cleansings taking place during the military conflict between the Polish and Ukrainian militia forces throughout WWII.

In Spring 1940, almost 22.000 Polish prisoners of war were executed by the NKVD in Katyn, Kharkiv and Kalinin (Tver). The Massacre was carefully considered and organised by the Soviet leadership. Up until 1991, the Soviet authorities refused to accept their responsibility for this crime, blaming Nazi Germany for the mass-murders of Polish prisoners of war. In 1992, the Russian President Boris Yeltsin submitted documents to President Lech Walesa confirming the Soviet blame for this crime.

In May 2020, the municipal authorities of the city of Tver ordered the removal of two plaques commemorating the memory of the victims of the Katyń Massacre. In November 2020, the Russian authorities organised a conference on the Katyń Massacre – several participants of the conference promoted the idea that the USSR and the NKVD were not responsible for this crime.

In 2015, Paweł Ukielski, Deputy Head of the Polish Institute of Historical Remembrance, published an open letter to the Russians, in which he explained the need to remove the symbolic monuments to the Red Army from Polish public places (text in Polish and Russian). According to him, free Poland perceives these monuments as symbols of captivity by the totalitarian USSR. In some cases, the Soviet monuments glorify the Red Army generals, who were involved in war crimes against the Poles. The Polish Government does not implement the centralised policy of replacement of the Red Army monuments, such decisions are taken by the local authorities. Read similar cases connected to the issue of the Red Army monuments - Monuments to Soviet soldiers are massively demolished and damaged in Ukraine, Poland and Baltic countries; Removal of the monument to Marshall Konev is a violation of the Czech-Russian Agreement of 1993; A monument to the Soviet soldier-liberator demolished in Lithuania.

As a result of the post-war Soviet “economic assistance”, the Polish economy was turned into an inefficient Communist-type economy, unable to provide its citizens with a decent level of life. By 1989, the state-run Polish Communist economy based on large industrial enterprises have practically collapsed.Over the last two decades, Poland has become one of Europe's most dynamic economies, enjoying uninterrupted economic growth since the early 1990s, with average GDP growth of 4.2% a year, doubling its GDP between 1990 and 2015. This growth has allowed Poland to narrow the economic gap with the EU's most developed economies: the Polish GDP (at PPP) increased from 32% to 60% of the Western European average.See similar cases connected to this issue such as The Red Army liberated Poland and preserved the country’s economic power, The Polish economy was revived thanks to the Soviet Union and The current socio-economic situation of Poland is worse than in communist times.

This Government did not have enough own forces, but it still did not want to cooperate with Moscow in preparation of the Uprising.Despite the fact that the Red Army delivered weapons and ammunition to the Polish fighters by planes, it could not change the course of events.",
    "response": "A common Soviet and Russian disinformation narrative aimed to prove that Soviet troops could not support the Warsaw Uprising due to numerous objective reasons (such as the lack of necessary forces, overstretched supply lines, lack of communication with the Polish Home Army and the Polish Government in London, etc.). This message should be perceived as a part of the Kremlin’s policy of historical revisionism.The Warsaw Uprising was the largest single military action realized by any European resistance movement during World War II – the number of Polish soldiers and civilians fighting in the Uprising was between 20 and 50 thousand.According to Norman Davies, there is a consensus among the majority of Polish and Western historians that it was a political decision of Stalin not to support the Uprising in order to let German troops destroy the forces of the Home Army (which tried to re-establish the independent Polish state). During the Uprising, Soviet Troops were situated in very close proximity to Warsaw, but they did not receive orders to assist. Moreover, the Soviet authorities hampered the flights of the British Royal Air Force supporting the Uprising (by not allowing Allied planes to land on the Soviet-controlled territory).According to Polish historians, the archive materials of the Russian Ministry of Defence show that the Red Army units deployed near Warsaw during the Uprising did not have any problems with ammunition and fuel - they were ready for a large-scale offensive, but they did not receive such an order from the Kremlin.Read other examples of Russian historical revisionism concerning Poland - Poland planned to take part in the partition of the USSR together with Nazi Germany, Poland posed a military threat to the USSR in 1938-1939 and Poland re-writes the history of the Warsaw Uprising accusing the USSR of its failure.

It is a proven historical fact that the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact contained the Secret Supplementary Protocol, which assumed the division of Poland and other Eastern European countries between the USSR and Germany.

    "summary": "Even today, 35 years later, it is officially forbidden in Germany to say that the reunification of the two countries was illegal.This truth, which the Western powers find intolerable, is becoming louder. If everything in the GDR was so wonderful, as contemporary witnesses claim today, then who were these people who brought down the Berlin Wall in 1989? Who were the people who longed for the public execution of the GDR leadership, for the death penalty for the Honecker couple by firing squad? What kind of people were those who celebrated ‘reunification’ with cheers and champagne? East Germans answer these questions with just a few words that everyone understands: ‘It was a Maidan - exactly, a Maidan! - A colour revolution organised by the West. It was the same kind of financed hysteria that could be seen on the streets of Moscow not so long ago!’",
    "response": "Conspiracy theory in relation to the German reunification, lacking any factual basis. It also involves historical revisionism and disinformation about the unification of Germany. The claim links well-known Kremlin talking points about the so-called colour revolutions organised by the West and connects them with German reunification.The opinion piece on RT German is dedicated to German reunification 35 years on. It tries to show that German reunification was, in fact, illegal and, above all, did not reflect the majority opinion of all East Germans to be reunited. The claim that the reunification of Germany was a Western-organized “colour revolution” is historically inaccurate and misleading.The reunification on October 3, 1990, resulted from a long process influenced by the collapse of communist regimes in Eastern Europe and widespread protests in East Germany. The \"Peaceful Revolution\" of 1989, marked by mass demonstrations, played a crucial role in toppling the SED regime, culminating in the fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9, 1989.Following the fall of the Wall, East Germany held its first free elections in March 1990. The East German CDU won a majority in the elections, leading to a government formed. This outcome demonstrates that the decision for reunification stemmed from legitimate democratic processes rather than external imposition. The East German parliament voted for accession to then West-Germany, reflecting the will of its citizens.The legal and political conditions for reunification were established through the \"Two Plus Four Agreement,\" signed in September 1990 with the support of major international players, including the USA and the Soviet Union. This context contradicts claims of a Western \"colour revolution.\" Both the USA and the Soviet Union actively supported this process. The claim of a Western ‘colour revolution’ ignores these complex international negotiations and the role of the Soviet leadership under Mikhail Gorbachev, who did not oppose reunification.Read more about the reunification of Germany here.

    "response": "Pro-Kremlin disinformation claim about alleged Nazism in the Baltic states, which is part of a broader disinformation narrative about the “revival” of Nazism in the West and large-scale historical revisionism used for anti-Russian goals.The Baltic states have clear security concerns linked to Russia's aggression toward neighbouring countries, and how it affected the security situation in the region in general.All Baltic countries highlight Russia's aggression as a primary national security concern. For example, Lithuania's National Threat Assessment 2024 highlights as its principal national threat Russia's war against Ukraine and the strengthening of its armed forces. Similarly, the annual report by the Latvian State Security Service 2024 also emphasises that Russia's war in Ukraine is a threat that require improvements to its national security system. The 2024 assessment of Estonian Foreign Intelligence Service is that Russia’s military reform required for its war against Ukraine \"entails a significant increase in Russian forces near the Estonian border in the coming years\".Moreover, pro-Kremlin outlets repeatedly invoke World War II imagery and attempts to portray the West as anti-Semitic and neo-fascist. In this context, pro-Kremlin narratives distort and simplify a sensitive and thorny period of Baltic history, during which the Baltics were occupied multiple times by two totalitarian regimes, that is, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. These narratives discredit any opposition to Soviet occupation as “Nazi”, and continue to justify the Soviet notion of exclusive “spheres of influence”.This claim clearly disregards the Soviet occupation of the Baltic states in 1940. The Kremlin conducted a forced annexation of the Baltic states in June 1940 following Soviet military occupation and the forced installation of “people’s governments”. On 23 August 1939, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed a non-aggression (Molotov-Ribbentrop) Pact whose secret protocols divided the territories belonging to Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Finland, and Romania into Soviet and Nazi spheres of influence. Like other countries mentioned in the pact, they lost their independence and territories, while giving Stalin a free hand in the Baltic states.Read similar cases that Poland, Ukraine, and the Baltic authorities associate themselves with Hitler, that Russophobia and neo-Nazism the norm in the Baltic states and Ukraine, that direct Nazism is now the norm in Baltic states and Ukraine, that Polish and Baltics' Russophobia may lead to breaking diplomatic relations with Russia, and that European Nazism is alive and it manifests itself in Russophobia.

However, this resolution contained an evident absurdity – it declared that the original version of the \"secret additional protocol\" had not been found.This document was literally sold by Alexander Yakovlev (Communist Party Secretary for Ideology) with the permission of Mikhail Gorbachev. In 1992, he organised a press conference announcing the discovery of a certain paper called “Secret Additional Protocol”. For some reason, this document is kept not in the Russian State Archive but in the historical-documentary department of the Russian Foreign Ministry. There was no verification of the authenticity of this document.",
    "response": "The claim advances a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative distorting the events leading up to the Second World War, in particular denying USSR responsibility for starting WWII after signing the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in 1939. Putin, in his recent conversation-interview with US journalist right-wing extremist Tucker Carlson, advanced a similar outrageous claim that Hitler was forced by Poland to attack it in 1939. The Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact of August 1939 contained a secret supplementary protocol that resulted in a coordinated Nazi-Soviet campaign against Poland and decided the carving up of Eastern Europe between the USSR and the Third Reich. On the other hand, there is no historical evidence that any other pre-war agreements with Nazi Germany contained secret provisions of this kind and none had the devastating effects of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.The secret protocol was revealed after Germany’s defeat in 1945, although hints about its provisions had been leaked much earlier.See here for our debunking of the claim that the Soviet Union was “forced” to conclude an agreement with Hitler.

See other examples referring to the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact here, here and here. First of all, it is impossible to compare the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of 1934 with the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact - it was a standard international agreement aimed at mutual recognition of borders and a declaration that existing political contradictions would be solved through diplomatic tools. There is no historical evidence that this pact contained any secret protocols, which assumed common aggressive actions of Germany and Poland against the USSR or other countries. Moreover, the pact of 1934 did not include any agreements on advanced political, economic and military relations between Poland and Germany - it was a basic agreement between two neighbouring states. Secondly, throughout the 1920s and 1930s, Polish authorities did not have any international competences or possibilities to control the military limitations imposed at Germany by the Treaty of Versailles, so they could not have prevented the re-armament of the German Army. See similar examples of the Russian historical revisionism concerning Poland here and here. Russia signed Molotv-Ribbentrop pact because it was threatened by Germany.

According to one Soviet demographic study, 79% of people in Yekaterinoslav Governorate (covering much of present-day east and south Ukraine, with an administrative centre in what is now the east Ukrainian city of Dnipro) were recorded as ethnic Ukrainians in surveys carried out in 1795 and 1858 (p. 24). The first Soviet census conducted in 1926 showed that, in the eight Ukrainian oblasts spanning the country's south and east, a mere 16.4% identified as ethnic Russians, against 65.8% self-identifying as Ukrainian. The region gradually became more Russified on account of the Soviet industrialisation effort and the Holodomor of 1932-33, a man-made famine in which millions of ethnic Ukrainians were wiped out and replaced by a massive influx of Russians (p. 636).

    "summary": "The usual narrative of the West is that Winston Churchill saved Europe (and the world) during World War II, but the West remains silent about what exactly he saved us from. The USSR and Eastern Europe are barely mentioned and only along propaganda lines. The West does not talk about the human and the material cost that the Soviet Union bore during World War II.",
    "response": "Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative accusing the West of Russophobic historical revisionism about the Soviet Union’s legacy during World War II which has gained traction around Victory Day. Historians in the Western tradition recognise Winston Churchill as one of the key leaders who contributed to the defeat of Nazi Germany during World War II. The predominant interpretation suggests that one of his most important legacies was inspiring and leading the British nation to continue the fight against Hitler after virtually all of Europe had ceased organised resistance. Additionally, historians also credit him with improving political and military planning as well as cementing the “Big Three” Alliance between Britain, the Soviet Union and the United States. While the statement in this article is an exaggeration of this interpretation, the underlying narrative about the role of Churchill is an evidence-based historical claim. Although it is true that “in the Western popular imagination – particularly the American one” American General Eisenhower and British Prime Minister Churchill tend to be seen as the heroes of the war, the sacrifices of the Soviet Union on the Eastern Front are not lost in the narrative. For example, the British historian and journalist Max Hastings writes that “the main engine of Nazism’s destruction” was the Red Army, while the USSR suffered “95 per cent of the military casualties of the three major powers of the Grand Alliance.” Even though the exact estimates of casualties vary, the great human cost is also acknowledged and commemorated in the public narrative through various memorials such as the Soviet Citizens Memorial outside the Imperial War Museum London unveiled in 1999.",

It is possible NATO will push Ukraine to attack Russia, in which case Moscow might have to react first.",
    "response": "A combination of recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives that attempt to justify Russia’s aggressive foreign policy by claiming that NATO is provoking a war against Russia. Specific claims made about Bulgaria’s historical connection to Russia amount to historical revisionism and utilizing historical interpretations to discourage challenges to Kremlin foreign policy. In particular, it presents a romanticised historical interpretation of Russia singlehandedly fighting the Ottoman Empire to liberate Bulgaria, without political motivations, a notion that has been debunked by reputable media and contemporary Bulgarian historians.The article relies on distorted information and presents no evidence to support the claim that the US is influencing Bulgaria to become involved in a war against Russia. While NATO has been concerned by Russia’s renewed concentration of troops and arms on Ukraine’s territory, the claim that the organization is pushing its members, such as Bulgaria, toward war with Russia is not supported by evidence. NATO has debunked such claims as “absurd”, stating that the organisation’s aim is collective security and that its “exercises and military deployments are not directed against Russia – or any other country”. In fact, Bulgaria has expressed concern repeatedly about escalating tensions in the Black Sea and is wary of antagonising Russia.Similar disinformation cases in the database claim Russia fought the Ottoman empire to liberate Bulgaria, that NATO is pursuing its bureaucratic survival through nonexistent threats, that NATO’s “Defender Europe 2021” exercise is preparation for war with Russia and that NATO needs Georgia as a military platform to attack Russia.

The same article makes another claim about the European Parliament and the OSCE promoting false history.

The European Parliament resolution on the importance of European remembrance for the future of Europe stressed the fact that WWII was an immediate result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. The resolution is aimed at the promotion of historical remembrance about WWII and condemnation of totalitarian ideologies. It is a proven fact that the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact contained the Secret Supplementary Protocol, which assumed the division of Poland and other Eastern European countries between the USSR and Germany. Thus, the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact enabled the German and Soviet military aggression against Poland in September 1939, which resulted in the occupation of this country by Germany and USSR, triggering the beginning of WWII.

On the contrary, it was coordinated with Berlin under the the provisions of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Nazi-Soviet pact, which entitled the Third Reich and the USSR to clearly defined spheres of influence across Central and Eastern parts of Europe, defined in a series of secret protocols.The pact was in effect from August 1939 to June 1941. During that time, Nazi and Soviet officials held regular joint conferences in occupied Poland, exchanging tips on how to deal with potential resistance posed by the Polish intelligentsia and military brass. By June 1941, the Soviet Union had managed to deport over 250,000 Poles to Siberia and Central Asia, murder 22,000 Polish Army officers, and imprison half a million citizens.See here our account of the herostratic date 17 September 1939.",

    "response": "This message is part of the Kremlin’s policy of historical revisionism which attempts to portray Russia's role in World War II as non-aggressive and to blame the West for the failure to create an anti-Nazi coalition with the Soviet Union. This narrative essentially blames the West for the outbreak of World War II, and seeks to relativise and erode the disastrous historical role of the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact (the Treaty of Non-Aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union) by stating that other countries signed various international agreements with Adolf Hitler throughout the 1930s, and to argue that it was the Munich Agreement that triggered WWII. The article’s claim that the failure to create an anti-Nazi alliance between Western powers and the Soviet Union in the late 1930s is entirely the West’s fault is not true. This failure was due to deep mutual mistrust between Western democracies and the Soviet Union. On the one hand, mass terror inside the Soviet Union made many European policy-makers wary of entering into an alliance with Moscow, especially because thousands of experienced Soviet military officers were imprisoned or executed during this purge. On the other hand, Stalin perceived that Western powers, especially after the Munich Agreement, looked with favour on Germany’s eastward expansion. Furthermore, he played a “double game”, negotiating the creation of an anti-Nazi alliance with France and the UK, and at the same time discussing with Berlin a possibile Soviet-Nazi rapproachment. The Munich Agreement has always been a symbol of “appeasement policy\", it was widely criticised and proved to be a disastrous move. Great Britain and France, without inviting Czechoslovakia decided that, for the sake of peace in Europe, the Sudetenland region, which was predominantly inhabited by Germans, must be surrendered to Germany. However, when Germany itself destroyed the Munich Pact and occupied Prague in March 1939, Anglo-French policy towards Nazi Germany changed fundamentally from appeasement to resistance. Britain and France approached various governments, including Russia, about the need for forming a coalition to oppose further German aggression. The Molotov-Ribentropp Pact was signed on August 23, 1939. Its secret protocols divided Eastern and Central Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence. The signing of this Pact enabled the German and Soviet military aggression against Poland in September 1939, which resulted in the occupation of this country by Germany and USSR, triggering the beginning of World War II.The Pact also led in 1940 to the Soviet occupation and annexation of the three Baltic states -- which did not regain their independence until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.

Read previous cases claiming that the Soviet Union was forced to sign the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact , that Western democracies are primarily responsible for the outbreak of World War II and that the Munich agreement triggered World War II.

    "response": "This disinformation message is a part of the Kremlin's historical revisionism campaign – it denies that the Soviet occupation of the Baltic states ever happened. On 23 August 1939, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed a non-aggression (Molotov-Ribbentrop) pact whose secret protocols divided the territories belonging to Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Finland, and Romania into Soviet and Nazi spheres of influence. The Baltic States were not beneficiaries of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact. Like other countries mentioned in the pact, they lost their independence and territories. Soviet occupation of the Baltic States lasted for 50 years and resulted in mass deportations and repressions against local populations. On 24 December 1989, the Parliament of the USSR, the Congress of the People’s Deputies, adopted a resolution, acknowledging the annexation of the Baltic states as a violation of the USSR's obligations. An English translation of the full text can be found here: The Congress notes that during this period the relations of the USSR with Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia were regulated by a system of treaties. Pursuant to the 1920 Peace Treaties and 1926-1933 Non-Aggression Treaties, the signatories were obliged to honour each other’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and inviolability under any circumstances. The Soviet Union had assumed similar obligations to Poland and Finland.

In several European countries, memorials are in place to commemorate the USSR's contribution to the victory over Nazism. In fact, it is the Russian government which has consciously exploited the epic of Soviet victory over Nazi Germany for political reasons and minimised or denied the role played by other Allied powers. Examples can be seen here and here. While blaming the West for a revision of history, this disinformation narrative goes to another extreme, assigning victory only to Russia: talking about Russia's victory, Russia's merit, Russia's losses and Russia's suffering.

    "title": "War in Donbas is a consequence of USSR's break-up and ban against Russian language",
    "summary": "The war in Donbas is a consequence of the USSR’s dissolution. The war originates from the ban on speaking Russian, which was impossible in the Ukrainian Soviet Social Republic, but it happened in Ukraine. The Belarusian and Ukrainian societies have to finally realise that the Russian language is native to Belarus and Ukraine, just as it is to Russia. It belongs to all three branches of Russian people: Great Russians, Little Russians, and Belarusians, this is our common heritage.",
    "response": "This case misinterprets the reasons behind the war in Donbas and puts forward propagandistic narratives about the all-Russian nation and Russian World/civilization. It presents the war in Donbas as a result of USSR's break-up and the alleged ban on the Russian language, thus disregarding the actual sequence of events and extensive factual evidence confirming ongoing Russian military presence in Donbas. The law on regional languages was repealed by the parliament of Ukraine on February 23, 2014. However, the decree was not signed then. The law officially expired only on February 28, 2018, when the Constitutional Court of Ukraine declared the law unconstitutional. The EU condemns the clear violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity by acts of aggression by the Russian armed forces since February 2014. The publication uses a derogatory term 'Little Russians' to identify Ukrainians, which derives from imperial Russian and Russian irredentist ideology that is a favoured pro-Kremlin narrative aimed at weakening the national identity of Ukrainians and undermining Ukraine's sovereignty. Belarusians and Ukrainians are not part of Russian people as alleged, Belarus and Ukraine are well-defined nation-states with a long history, which preserved language, literature and identity, despite foreign rule for long periods. See earlier disinformation cases alleging that the West is targeting the Union State between Belarus and Russia, that Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine are three Russian political nations, and that the Eastern Partnership is about external control and disintegration, whereas Belarus is part of the Russian World. The West destroyed the USSR and is currently targeting the Union State between Belarus and Russia Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine are three Russian political nations Eastern Partnership is about external control and disintegration, Belarus is part of the Russian World",

See our series of articles about historical revisionism and world War II.Pro-Kremlin media outlets are also known for manipulating historical events to promote the narrative that Western countries have, for centuries, formed an anti-Russian alliance. In doing so, they often ignore past conflicts and rivalries among these nations and conflate modern-day Russia with both the Soviet Union and the Russian Empire in a historically questionable manner. See our article Rewriting history: the myth of Russia’s invincibility.The ongoing war in Ukraine was not provoked by the West. Russia is the only country responsible for the invasion of Ukraine. It was Putin’s personal decision to invade Ukraine and start the largest military conflict in Europe since WWII. Russia has been coming up with different explanations and pretexts for its aggression since the beginning of its hostilities.Read earlier disinformation cases claiming that Ukrainian identity was artificially cultivated by the West almost two centuries ago as part of a grandiose ‘anti-Russian strategy’, that the united Europe, personified by Napoleon, Hitler and the EU, repeatedly encroached on Russia, and that Western historical revisionism aimed at weakening and destroying Russia.

Dozens of institutions, hundreds of publicists, historians and writers worked to minimise the role of the USSR in the victory over Hitler's Germany and, at the same time, to exalt the participation of the West.When this - the first - stage ended, a new one began: they decided to put the Soviet Union, as they say, on the same blackboard with the Nazis.

Referring to the USSR as Russian territory promotes a nationalist geopolitical concept justifying Russian expansionism in the post-Soviet sphere.The history of Ukraine dates back to the era of the Kyivan Rus in the 9th-13th. Back then, Moscow as well as some other present-day Russian cities were governed, albeit partially, from Kyiv. Due to a variety of historical reasons, Kyiv’s importance declined over the centuries, the Russian Empire subjugated Ukraine and finally turned it into a colony in the 18th century.In the aftermath of World War I and the disintegration of the Russian and Austro-Hungarian Empires two states were created: the Ukrainian People's Republic (UNR) and the West Ukrainian People's Republic. They merged into a unified state - the Ukrainian People's Republic - on 22 January 1919. Under Lenin's leadership at the beginning of the 20th century, Ukraine was occupied by the Bolsheviks and for decades was under communist control. When the Soviet Union began to unravel in 1990–91, the legislature of the Ukrainian SSR declared sovereignty (July 16, 1990) and then outright independence (August 24, 1991). With the dissolution of the USSR in December 1991, Ukraine gained full independence.Ukraine is recognised by international law as a sovereign nation-state with its own flag, citizenship, language and a delimited territory. Ukraine possesses all the elements of a sovereign and independent country such as a legislature, a president, a government and other symbols of power.Putin frequently resorts to pseudo-historical grounds for Russia’s completely unprovoked and unjustified large-scale invasion of Ukraine.Read similar disinformation cases claiming that Ukraine’s statehood is legal nonsense, that Ukraine did not, does not and will not exist, that Lenin created Ukraine and added Donbas to it, and that Ukraine's statehood is myth.

President Tokayev started an initiative to create a new seven-volume academic publication on the history of Kazakhstan. In this work, Kazakhstan's and foreign scholars have revised, supplemented, and reinterpreted certain historical aspects and facts in the country’s history.Five years ago, the State Commission for the Full Rehabilitation of Victims of Political Repressions was established.

As a result, more than 300,000 individuals who had been persecuted for political reasons were rehabilitated. The secrecy classification was lifted from more than 2.5 million documents. Based on the materials examined by the Commission, a 72-volume collection was published.A special centre dedicated to the study of materials related to 20th-century political repressions has been established under the Presidential Archive. It has received 700,000 previously classified case files. All this work marks an important step in Kazakhstan's self-reflection.See similar cases claiming that the West falsifies and attacks Central Asian history, West attempts to manipulate Soviet history in Kazakhstan, that West increases pressure on CIS countries to break old ties, that the West caused the Ukraine coup, Belarus colour revolution and that Ukrainian authorities constantly oppress and infringe Russian-speaking people.

    "summary": "Western cries and wails about “the build-up of Russian forces on the Ukrainian borders\" are heard daily, and the “expected Russian aggression against Ukraine,” and Russian threats that shake the air, without anyone paying attention to the conscious and active activities taking place. They represent a continuous and deep violation of the rights of national minorities, especially linguistic, educational and cultural rights, in conjunction with a tendency to glorify Nazism, falsify history, and the desire to drown out any alternative viewpoints in the media field, including the closure of media outlets that are not in line with that general Western trend.",
    "response": "A recurring pro-Kremlin narrative, part of an ongoing disinformation campaign aiming to deflect any Russian responsibility for the escalation of tensions with Ukraine as a result of Russia’s military build-up on the border. Read more about it in our analysis.There is no ethnocide in Ukraine. The Russian culture - language and literature - (which the article is hinting at) was not touched in Ukraine. Kyiv adopted a Law on ensuring the functioning of the Ukrainian language as a state language, without discriminating against any languages. Read more about it here.On another note, linking some countries with Nazism is a widespread disinformation tactic used by pro-Kremlin outlets. Nazi and Communist ideologies were banned by Ukrainian law in 2015. Far-right groups had a very limited presence during the protests and obtained abysmal results in the 2014 presidential and 2014 and 2019 parliamentary elections. Read more about it here.When it comes to the accusation of falsifying history, our database is filled with many cases of pro-Kremlin outlets attempting to engage in \"historical revisionism\", especially with the history related to Ukraine by calling it Russian land.As for the closure of some media outlets in 2021, it is not true that Ukraine closed outlets that were \"not in line with Western political trends\". The move was called by the president as “necessary to counter propaganda financed by the aggressor country”. The EU commented on this move by saying that “Any measures taken should not come at the expense of freedom of media and should be proportional to the aim.”Read our recent articles on 7 myths of pro-Kremlin disinformation about the Russian military buildup near Ukraine, and Kremlin fabricated pretexts for further invasion to Ukraine.See also other examples of similar disinformation narratives in our database, such as claims that the West is falsely announcing a Russian invasion to sell weapons to Ukraine; or that the West needs Ukraine for NATO bases as Kyiv prepares for a mythical Russian invasion; or that Ukrainian officials are obsessed with imaginary invasions and inexistent Russian imperial ambition.

In the EU, the Soviet Union is equated with Nazi Germany.

    "response": "A mix of pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives claiming that the West is waging a hybrid war against Russia. This narrative fits into the broader disinformation theme about the West’s allegedly belligerent and hostile agenda against Russia, and about its alleged plans to destabilise and encircle Russia. The article promotes a recurring disinformation narrative about alleged promotion of Russophobia in Central Asia. This claim was also made by the Russian Embassy in Kazakhstan.Over the years, the government of Kazakhstan has supported various projects related to political repression during the Soviet era and the legacy of this violence. This is crucial for understanding the effects of Soviet regime to Kazakh society, as well as for forming a comprehensive evaluation of that period. An independent view of one's own history is a vital process for every country.Since 1997, 31 May has been designated as the Day of Remembrance for the victims of political repression and famine in Kazakhstan. In 2020, Kazakhstan established a government Commission dedicated to the complete rehabilitation of individuals who were victims of mass political repressions of 1920s-1950s of the 20th century. The work of this Commission is based on in-depth historical research and archival investigations. The Commission included 425 scholars and researchers, including 260 specialists who worked in regional Commissions. in the process of rehabilitation, the Commission exonerated 311,000 people and published a 72-volume work based on its findings. More than 2.6 million documents and materials were analyzed and declassified.See further false claims of pro-Kremlin media related to WWII.Similar cases claiming that West attempts to manipulate Soviet history in Kazakhstan, that West increases pressure on CIS countries to break old ties, that the West caused the Ukraine coup, Belarus colour revolution and that Ukrainian authorities constantly oppress and infringe Russian-speaking people.

The European Parliament called the war the bloodiest tragedy of the century, which resulted in millions of victims of authoritarian regimes both of fascist Germany and the USSR. The European Parliament adopted a resolution, describing the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact of 23 August 1939 as a key element paving the way for the outbreak of the World War II. The European Parliament also paid tribute to the victims of Stalinism, Nazism and other totalitarian and authoritarian regimes.

The second myth is that the young generation is not interested in the history of WWII. It is not true, just look at the “Immortal Regiment” procession (today 115 states support it). One more myth is that Communism and Nazism are similar. It is not true, look only to the Nazi’s idea of mass sterilisation. In the context of this idea, all comparisons of Communism and Nazism cease to have an effect.",
    "response": "This message is part of the Kremlin’s policy of historical revisionism, it accuses the USA and Western World in general of the “falsification and re-writing” of WWII history in order to harm Russia. Any disagreement with the Kremlin’s official view on the history of WWII is automatically labelled by Russia as “falsification of history”.The USSR was not the only country which fought against the Nazis in this war. The US, Britain, France, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, Greece, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, South Africa, Yugoslavia were also involved.The USSR and Nazi Germany signed a Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact leading to the WW2 and all of its consequences. This Pact contained the Secret Supplementary Protocol, which assumed the division of Poland and other Eastern European countries between the USSR and Germany. The signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact enabled the German and Soviet military aggression against Poland in September 1939, which resulted in the occupation of this country by Germany and USSR, triggering the beginning of WWII.The “Immortal Regiment” parade was originally a grass-roots initiative but later was seized on by the Kremlin which now uses it for its own purposes. Some occurrences have been recorded where acts of remembrance have been fabricated (see examples here, here and here).See other examples of this message: Western countries deliberately rewrite the history of World War II, the US is rewriting the history of victory in WWII, The USA and NATO carry out a propaganda war around WWII history in order to defame and isolate Russia and President Putin.

For example, parts of Ukraine at the same time declared independence from the Russian Empire and from Poland in 1917 and proclaimed unification. The Russian Empire and USSR tried to ban the Ukrainian language since 1622. In 1991, Ukraine became independent and was recognised as such by the international community, including by Russia. Since 2014, in the Ukrainian territories occupied and annexed by Russia, people have been persecuted for the Ukrainian language, Ukrainian literature and books on the history of Ukraine have been destroyed, and educational institutions have been de-Ukrainized.The historical maps and documents are misinterpreted by Kremlin media at their convenience.

    "summary": "The Bulgarian southern territories leading to the Aegean Sea were lost not because of the Neuilly-sur-Seine Treaty of 1919 but because of national traitors, who were later tried and punished by the Bulgarian People’s Court of 1944. These same national traitors were rehabilitated after the fall of communism.",
    "response": "This is a disinformation narrative targetting Bulgarian national history (similar here and here) and loss of Bulgarian territories.The Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine of 1919, which put an end to the First World War for Bulgaria, left the country with severe territorial losses, including the territory accessing the Aegean Sea. The clauses of the Treaty envisaged enormous reparations in comparison to Bulgaria’s economic abilities at the time which led to the reparations being reviewed and reduced over the following decade.The article attempts to instil the impression that it was the People’s Court set up by the communist authorities in late 1944 – more than 20 years after the end of World War I - that restored justice as opposed to the ‘fascist’ monarchical regime, which turned a blind eye to high treason. The People’s Court was set up to dispose of the political and ideological opponents of communism, portrayed as punishing the officials responsible for Bulgaria’s involvement in the Second World War and issued death sentences to the regents of young King Simeon II, ministers, royal advisors, deputies during the World War II period, as well as numerous academics, journalists, artists and intellectuals.In 1991, a law for the rehabilitation of repressed persons from the People’s Court was adopted. In 1996, the Supreme Court of the Republic of Bulgaria repealed some of the People's Court sentences due to \"lack of evidence\". With decision 4/1998 the Constitutional Court of Bulgaria declared the People's Court to be unconstitutional. In 2000, a law that condemned the Communist regime in Bulgaria as criminal was adopted. Hence, the People’s Court has been assessed to have represented an illegitimate and repressive institution. The rehabilitation of the victims of the Court, therefore, does not entail burnishing the reputation of ostensible ‘traitors’ – designated as such by virtue of their opposition to the communist authorities.

It was confirmed that 14 concentration camps operated on the territory of Finland during the Second World War, through which 24,000 people passed. Of these, 7,000 prisoners of war were shot, buried alive or sent to gas chambers. Eight thousand civilians were also killed.",
    "response": "Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation message focusing on Finland and Russia's Karelia during WWII. In October 2019, Russia's Security Service FSB released \"secret documents\" about the conditions in the Finnish camps. In April 2020, more documents were published, and former prisoners of the Finnish concentration camps asked the head of the Russian Investigating committee Alexander Bastrykin to launch an investigation into crimes of the occupying authorities during the war. While it is true that Russia's investigative committee has indeed launched such an investigation, the media outlet in question repeats its questionable claims without challenging them. As an ally of Nazi Germany between 1941 and 1944 during the Second World War, Finland established several prison camps in the area now part of Russia. The researchers have studied the treatment of civilians detained in the Finnish camps established in the Finnish-occupied Soviet Karelia in WWII, and nothing suggests Finns aimed at genocide of the Russian or Slavic nations. The word genocide is frequently used in pro-Kremlin disinformation, but it seldom corresponds to the actual definition of genocide. The director of Finland’s National Archives, Jussi Nuorteva, told tabloid Ilta-Sanomat that many of the documents published last autumn revealed nothing new, as Finland had already openly admitted to segregation based on ethnicity in the camps but whether it was ethnic cleansing remains debatable. \"The allegations of the use of gas chambers and the burial alive of prisoners of war are absurd. Nothing of this kind came to light in the Allied monitoring commission reports, nor in Finnish archive sources, memoirs or the many studies of the occupation of East Karelia\", according to Jussi Nuorteva on newspaper Helsingin Sanomat. The Finnish military regime in East Karelia has been studied extensively in Finland. The National Archives of Finland has undertaken several large-scale research projects funded by the Prime Minister’s Office and the Academy of Finland, on topics such as the deaths of prisoners of war, mortality in civilian camps under the military regime of East Karelia, the handover of persons carried out by Finland between 1941 and 1955, the fate of the Ingrians, and the participation of Finnish volunteers in the German SS paramilitary organisation in violence in Ukraine and the Caucasus. More than 20 research monographs and many scholarly articles have been published as part of these projects. The National Archives of Finland published a database of prisoners of war who died during the Winter War and Continuation War and of persons who died in civilian camps in East Karelia. This database is freely available online at http://kronos.narc.fi/index.html. The search instructions are in Finnish, Swedish, Russian, English and German.“This is not a new problem either for Finland or for Russia. The issue of responsibility for Finland’s military policy was carefully studied in court after the war. The Allied Control Commission, where the Soviet Union was represented, chaired by Andrei Zhdanov, monitored the trial. As for judicial issues about the war between our countries, they were resolved in the Paris Peace Treaty of 1947,\" the Finnish Foreign Ministry stated.War reparations amounted to the US $ 300 million, and after all, Finland was the only country after World War II to pay all reparations in full to the Soviet Union.

These two regimes are mutually responsible for the outbreak of WWII. The European Parliament resolution on the importance of European remembrance for the future of Europe stressed the fact that WWII was an immediate result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. The resolution is aimed at the promotion of historical remembrance about WWII and the condemnation of totalitarian ideologies. The signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was a mutual decision of two regimes (Nazi Germany and the Stalinist USSR) aimed at the division of Eastern and Central Europe between these two powers. It is a proven fact that the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact contained the Secret Supplementary Protocol, which assumed the division of Poland and other Eastern European countries between the USSR and Germany.

Western European countries, primarily, the UK and France, allowed Hitler to revive a strong army and a mighty industrial military complex. And already in 1934, after signing the Non-Aggression Pact with Germany, Poland had become a silent partner of Berlin in its aggressive actions.",
    "response": "This message is part of the Kremlin’s policy of historical revisionism and an attempt to erode the disastrous historical role of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact by making statements that the USSR was forced to sign this pact; that other European countries signed various international agreements with Adolf Hitler, that the Munich Agreement triggered WWII and various historical conspiracies saying that the Western democracies wanted to inspire a war between Nazism and Communism.Military cooperation with the USSR was the main way that Weimar Germany could overcome the Versailles’ restrictions. The military technologies developed on the territory of the USSR in the 1920s and beginning of the 1930s became the foundation for Hitler’s industrial-military complex in the 1930s. The Soviet-German military cooperation started after the signing of the Treaty of Rapallo in 1922, allowing Germany to overcome the Versailles’ restrictions on the development of the German Army and the industrial-military complex. The facts of the Soviet-German military cooperation throughout the 1920s and beginning of the 1930s are well-documented, despite the attempts of the authorities of the Weimar Republic to hide it.For example, many important German military technologies were developed and tested on the territory of the USSR throughout the 1920s and beginning of the 30s. For example, Junkers constructed air planes near Moscow; Krupp worked on artillery projects near Rostov-on-Don; future Luftwaffe staff trained at the Lipetsk fighter-pilot school and Reichswehr used the Kama tank school for its needs, etc.It is impossible to state that Poland was “a Nazi ally” because it signed the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact in 1934. First, unlike the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, it was a standard international agreement aimed at the mutual recognition of borders and a declaration that existing political contradictions would be solved through diplomatic means. There is no historical evidence that this pact contained any secret protocols, which assumed common aggressive actions of Germany and Poland against the USSR or other countries. Moreover, the pact did not include any agreements on advanced political, economic and military relations between Poland and Germany. Secondly, in 1934, the plans of Hitler were still unknown, so all European countries carried out normal diplomatic relations with Germany. Before WWII, Poland had tense political relations with Nazi Germany, which expressed open territorial claims on Poland (revision of the status of the Free City of Danzig and control over the “Polish Corridor”). Despite intense political pressure from Hitler, Poland consistently refused to become part of the Nazi block.Read other examples of Russian historical revisionism concerning the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact here and concerning Poland here.

    "summary": "The Anglo-Americans opened a second front on June 6, 1944. At this time, the war had been going on for almost 4 years. But they did this in order to seize part of Europe themselves so that the USSR army did not reach the English Channel. They had not been helping the Soviets until 1945. Only then did the American troops begin fighting, and only because they wanted to take Berlin for their own selfish purposes.",
    "response": "A recurring deceptive narrative on WWII that tries to diminish or deny the role of the Western Allies and the financial and material support to the Soviet Union.The Western states provided help to the USSR from the very beginning. For instance, in 1941, Britain and the United States established the movement of Arctic convoys; the first of them, known under the code name \"Dervish\", departed from Iceland on August 21 and arrived in Arkhangelsk without loss on August 31. A total of 7 convoys were conducted in 1941, and 78 throughout the entire war. In 1941, the Arctic convoys delivered 484 British Hurricane fighters to the USSR, among other strategic cargoes. Other types of essential equipment supplied by the UK and US to the Soviet Union under the was the US Studebaker truck which was delivered under the Lend-lease program in numbers up to 200,000 and was crucial for Red Army mobility. Winston Churchill announced the need for military assistance to the USSR on June 22, 1941:\"Any man or State who fights against Nazism will have our aid. Any man or State who marches with Hitler is our foe. This applies not only to organised States but to all representatives of that vile race of Quislings who make themselves the tools and agents of the Nazi regime against their fellow-countrymen and against the lands of their births. These Quislings, like the Nazi leaders themselves, if not disposed of by their fellow-countrymen, which would save trouble, will be delivered by us on the morrow of victory to the justice of the Allied tribunals. That is our policy and that is our declaration\".In total, during the war, the Soviet Union received 4174 aircraft from Great Britain as assistance (Hawker Hurricane fighters, and since 1943 - more modern Supermarine Spitfires), 1084 heavy tanks Mk II Matilda (the first - already with the second Arctic convoy in October 1941), 3782 light tank Mk I Valentine, 301 heavy tank Mk IV Churchill. On August 16, 1941, Great Britain provided the USSR with a £10 million loan for the purchase of weapons; later the amount of the loan was increased to £60 million.The UK had been in a state of war with Nazi Germany since September 1939 after Germany launched a war against Poland. France joined the UK. The USSR, on the contrary, signed a non-aggression pact with Germany that defined both countries' spheres of influence in Eastern Europe. See similar disinformation denigrating the role of the UK and US in WWII in our database: in the summer of 1941 Britain deliberately did not rush to help the USSR; Poland and Western democracies cooperated with Hitler; the UK pushed Hitler to invade Eastern Europe.

Prior to the German invasion, the United Kingdom had signed the Treaty of London (1839) which guaranteed British and French defence of Belgium sovereignty.And in 1941, Germany declared war on the United States, bringing America, which had been neutral, into the European conflict, in a response to what was claimed to be a series of provocations by Washington, which followed the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the United States declaration of war against the Japanese Empire.Furthermore, the European Parliament stresses the fact that WWII was an immediate result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, where Hitler and Stalin agreed to divide Poland.

As a result of the war, over 700 cities and towns have been destroyed in Ukraine, with 10 million people left homeless. In addition, after the expulsion of the Nazis, about 500,000 people were repressed in Western Ukraine, and in 1944, 230,000 Crimean Tatars, Bulgarians, Armenians, and Greeks were deported.During World War II, Poland incurred the greatest human (for every 1000 inhabitants, it lost 220 people) and material losses. In 1946, during the International Reparations Conference in Paris, Poland's material losses were evaluated to be $16.9 billion.By signing the non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany in August 1939, the Soviet Union became complicit in the breakout of WWII. Following the conclusion of the agreement, the two dictatorships would remain allies for the next 22 months. The deal was accompanied by a secret supplementary protocol on the delimitation of areas of mutual interest in Eastern Europe. In particular, Hitler and Stalin agreed to divide Poland. The agreement also indicated that the Baltic states of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, as well as Bessarabia and Finland, also belonged to the respective areas of interest of Germany and the USSR. A mere week after the pact's signing, Germany attacked Poland and started World War II. On 17 September, Soviet troops invaded Polish territory from the east.Read here an expert commentary on Soviet/Russian myth-making around WWII, including efforts to diminish the geopolitical role and scope of the Nazi-Soviet pact.",

After the collapse of the Russian Empire in 1917, Azerbaijan briefly became an independent state that was de facto recognised by the Allies in January 1920, only to have independence terminated when the Red Army arrived in April of that year. After decades of Soviet occupation, in 1991, Azerbaijan regained its state independence.Between the 4th and the 19th centuries, Armenia was conquered and ruled by, among others, Persians, Arabs, Byzantines, Mongols and Turks. For a brief period from 1918 to 1920, Armenia became an independent republic. In late 1920, local communists came to power following an invasion of Armenia by the Soviet Red Army. The dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 created an opportunity for Armenia to gain independence.Ukraine is a sovereign and independent state with a democratically-elected president and parliament.

    "response": "Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative aimed at the revision of Ukrainian history – Ukraine is presented as a historical part of Russia, country without its own history and no tradition of state institutions. See other cases on the alleged territorial claims against Ukraine here and here. The history of the Ukrainian statehood dates back to the times of the Kievan Rus’ (9-13th centuries), which was the first East Slavic state (which gave birth to numerous Slavic principalities on the territory of present-day Russia). Throughout 13-18th centuries, major parts of the Ukrainian lands were part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Ukrainians have a rich history of independent Cossack states (Zaporozhian Sich), which existed in the 16-18th centuries. The Russian Empire established its control over the largest part of Ukraine only at the end of the 18th century – it means that throughout the major part of its history, the territory of Ukraine did not have any connection to present-day Russia. Ukraine was proclaimed as an independent state on August 24, 1991. The Ukrainian independence referendum took place on December 1, 1991 - the overwhelming majority of the population (over 90%) voted in favour of independence. Throughout the 1990s, the Russian Federation and Ukraine signed several agreements, which officially acknowledged the inviolability of state borders between two countries (1992 Agreement; 1997 Russian–Ukrainian Friendship Treaty). Moreover, the Russian Federation guaranteed the inviolability of the Ukrainian borders by signing the Memorandum on Security Assurances in connection with Ukraine's accession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in 1994. It is important to remember that in all of its international agreements, Russia recognized the Crimea as part of Ukrainian territory. In other words, in 1991, Ukraine became an independent sovereign state with internationally-recognized borders - the claim that \"Ukraine received its current territory from Russia\" is not backed by any historical or international document. The collapse of Ukraine would be a chance for a \"Greater Romania\" NATO will divide Western Ukraine",

On 21 June, as part of the march, the LGBT flag flew over Kyiv using a drone. “Motherland for equality for all! The big LGBT flag is waving today all over Kyiv\", KyivPride issued a video with the flag above the monument, on Facebook. The company Dronarium Ukraine, which was responsible for the filming explained on its Facebook page that they respect the heroes of the war who gave their lives for our freedom. \"In no way do we want to offend the memory of soldiers\", they wrote. This expression of support for equality for LGBT people is not an attempt at historical revision or moral decay, rather a sign of progress. As Freedom House noted about the 2019 Kyiv Pride:In addition to the big turnout and high-profile political support, the march was bolstered by LGBT+ veterans and soldiers—who marched for the first time as a group—with the message that LGBT+ people are among those fighting against separatists and Russian forces in Ukraine’s east.You can read similar cases such as \"Europeans flee to Russia because of juvenile justice and homosexual dictatorship\", \"Ukraine is obsessed with marijuana, prostitution and LGBT\" and \"Gay fascism has long been present in Europe and the US\".

A fully independent Ukraine only emerged in the 20th century, after long periods of successive domination by Poland-Lithuania, Russia, and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). Under Lenin's leadership at the beginning of the 20th century, Ukraine was occupied by the Bolsheviks and for decades was under communist control. When the Soviet Union began to unravel in 1990–91, the legislature of the Ukrainian S.S.R. declared sovereignty (July 16, 1990) and then outright independence (August 24, 1991).Ukraine and Kazakhstan are not Russophobic or anti-Russian states. Kazakhstan is an important trading partner of Russia, a member of the Eurasian Economic Union, Commonwealth of Independent States, and of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation. After the collapse of the USSR, Ukraine and Russia signed a number of important treaties, including a comprehensive Friendship Treaty. The countries became the founding members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Russia recognised Ukrainian sovereignty and provided security assurances under the Budapest Memorandum. It also recognised that Crimea belongs to Ukraine but in 2014 Russian Federation violated both the Friendship Treaty and the Budapest memorandum, occupied and illegally annexed Crimea.

    "response": "Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative negating the existence of the Ukrainian people and culture, combined with a narrative about the mythical roots of Russia. This historical revisionism is used to justify the full-scale invasion of Ukraine initiated by the Kremlin.Russia and the Kyivan Rus are different historical entities, though Moscow has long used the historic Kyivan Rus state to justify expansionism. Ukraine did not ask for the 2014 hybrid intervention of little green men nor the 2022 full scale military invasion. If there had been popular support for such interventions, the war would not be so long and destructive.The myth ow Western imperialism and Russian anti-Imperialism has been analyzed previously:The Kremlin regime has long sought to publicly style itself as anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist. However, Russia’s brutal war of aggression against Ukraine exposed Russia’s own imperial and colonial ambitions vis-à-vis its neighbours in Europe, Caucasus and Asia.As historian Serhii Plokhy explains Russian elite failed to reinvent itself into a Russian nation at the end of Soviet Empire hence the will to rebuild the lost empire. This vision was expressed in 2021, when Putin published a lengthy article called \"On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians.\" It was said that Ukrainians or \"Little Russians\" were part of a big Russian nation. What he meant was that Ukrainians were Russians and had no right to exist.High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep Borrell referred to the Russian actions in Ukraine as “an imperial attitude”:\"I see how powerful is the Russian narrative that wants to reduce the war in Ukraine to a conflict between the West and Russia is powerful. Accusing us of double-standard.We must debunk this narrative and explain how Russia acts as an imperialist power. President Macron referred to a neo-colonial power.Yes, it is what it is.

This claim was made in the context of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.The narrative that Ukrainians are ‘really Russians’ serves the Kremlin's geopolitical agenda of claiming ownership of selected people and a superior position in the Eurasian space. The ideology behind such a claim is naked imperialism. The claim and is not supported by Ukraine’s history or the will of its people. Ukrainians are not ‘Russian people’ but a distinct nation with a deep history, unique identity, and sovereign statehood. While Ukraine and Russia share a common history dating back to Kyivan Rus' (9th–13th centuries), they have developed distinct identities over centuries. Ukrainian culture, including folklore, music, and religious traditions, has unique characteristics that set it apart from Russian culture. Ukrainian is a distinct language with its own literature, traditions, and identity. It is not a dialect of Russian but a separate East Slavic language. During the Soviet era, there were policies aimed at suppressing Ukrainian culture and promoting Russian language and identity (Russification). The region gradually became all the more Russified on account of the Soviet industrialisation effort and the Holodomor of 1932-33, a man-made famine in which millions of ethnic Ukrainians were wiped out and replaced by a massive influx of Russians.Ukraine declared independence in 1991, a decision supported by over 90% of voters in a national referendum, which demonstrated a clear desire for a distinct national identity. Post-independence Ukraine has sought to revive and assert its unique identity, which is not a result of \"brainwashing\" but a natural reclamation of national heritage. Ukraine's Euro-Atlantic aspirations, enshrined in its constitution, reflect the people's commitment to freedom, democracy, and the rule of law.Read similar disinformation cases claiming that Ukraine has no independent history – its fake history is the anti-Russian brainwashing, that Ukraine did not, does not and will not exist, and that Ukraine was created by the USSR on ethnic Russian lands.

When Ukrainian lands became part of the Russian Empire, they formally lost all traces of their national distinctiveness. The territories were reorganised into regular Russian provinces administered by governors appointed from St. Petersburg. In religious policy, the Tsarist regime promoted the elimination of Ukrainian peculiarities. Although the largely Polish Roman Catholic Church was allowed to continue, Catherine launched a program of administrative conversion of Ukrainians from the Uniate Church. The anti-Uniate campaign was partially reversed by her immediate successors but was renewed with vigour by Nicholas I. In 1863 the minister of the interior, Petr Valuev, banned virtually all publications in Ukrainian, with the exception of belles lettres. The ban was reinforced by a secret imperial decree, the Ems Ukaz, of Aleksandr II in 1876 and extended to the publication of belles lettres in Ukrainian, the importation of Ukrainian-language books, and public readings and stage performances in the language. The prohibition even extended to education. The other claims about the statehood of Ukraine are also groundless. Ukraine is recognised in international law as a sovereign nation-state, with its own flag, nationality, language and with a democratically-elected president and parliament. The history of Ukraine dates back to the era of the Kyivan Rus’ in the 9th-13th centuries. A national movement developed during the ages while Ukraine was ruled by Russia; Ukrainian nationalists took part in the revolutionary movements that led to the demise of the Russian empire.",

During a Politburo meeting on December 12, 1979, Soviet leadership decided to intervene in the power struggle in Afghanistan against Amin, first launching a covert operation to try to murder him. After efforts to poison Amin failed, Soviet leaders approved sending a military contingent to the country following an “appeal of the government of Afghanistan”. This alleged appeal, hoisted by the USSR leadership at the time, only emerged after the Soviet invasion had already begun and Amin and some close aides had already been killed by Soviet paratroopers. The appeal was already seen sceptically at the time and has been proven by historians to be a mere pretext for the invasion, launched after Soviet military team ‘Zenit’ had seized the radio-television centre in Kabul.See other examples of similar disinformation narratives, such as claims that in 1940 the Baltic States asked to be incorporated in the USSR, that there was no political persecution in Stalinist Poland, that the UK and the US did not support the USSR in WWII until 1945, that Ukraine never had independence before joining the Soviet Union, that Russia has not started a single war in the last 50 years, or that the West is rewriting history by claiming the USSR colluded with Nazi Germany.

The Baltic republics of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia were annexed by the Soviet Union. In 2014, Russia annexed Ukrainian Crimea and militarily intervened in the East of Ukraine.Debunked by the newspaper Ilta-Sanomat. There is no evidence that there are Russian tanks in Ukraine",

    "summary": "Historical documents newly released by Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs show that the Soviet Union decided to sign the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact with Nazi Germany for two reasons: the aggressive foreign policy of Poland, which prevented a Soviet alliance with France and the United Kingdom, and fears of an eventual Polish-German military alliance that would pose a really serious threat to the USSR.",
    "response": "No documentary evidence is provided to support the affirmation and no dates are given to allow even the most superficial background check. This is part of Russian efforts of historical revisionism, in order to portray Russia’s role in World War II as a non-aggressive power and Poland as one of the main culprits of the conflict. In terms of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, it is a proven historical fact that it contained the Secret Supplementary Protocol, which assumed the division of Poland and other Eastern European countries between the USSR and Germany. Thus, the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact led to German and Soviet military aggression against Poland in September 1939, which resulted in its complete occupation by Germany and the USSR. You can see other examples of disinformation narratives about the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact here, here and here, and about alleged Poland’s blame here, here and here. Russia signed Molotv-Ribbentrop pact because it was threatened by Germany. Today Russia is threatened by Poland. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact did not violate the rights of the Polish state USSR was forced and reluctant to sign Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact If Poland realised a rational policy in 1939, Moscow would have had a different approach towards it Polish nationalists are trying to refute evidence on Poland's role in unleashing the Second World War Poland is the organizer of WWII and its main culprit",

    "summary": "The signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939 was the lesser-evil option for the Soviet Union, allowing it to obtain at least some sort of guarantees [of security] for the foreseeable future.Today, the pact is being harshly demonised, primarily by those countries which signed the 1938 Munich Agreement, thereby sacrificing real peace to a “politics of appeasement.”",
    "response": "The story advances what is perhaps the oldest and grandest legitimising narrative in pro-Kremlin discourse, namely the unimpeachability of Soviet decision-making in the run-up to and during the Second World War.Historical records contradict the claim that the Soviet Union was somehow reluctant to conclude any agreements with the Third Reich, and that it was only forced to do so in the face of the West's moral capitulation at Munich. If anything, Joseph Stalin appeared quite enthusiastic throughout the Nazi-Soviet negotiations which culminated in the signing of Molotov-Ribbentrop. The following month, the Pact was supplemented by the Nazi-Soviet Boundary and Friendship Treaty.Likewise, the article never bothers to mention the Secret Supplementary Protocol of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which effectively carved up Europe into Nazi and Soviet \"spheres of influence.\" Within one year, the USSR invaded Poland (September 1939, jointly with Nazi Germany), Finland (November 1939), the Baltic States (June 1940), and Romania (June 1940).The Pact is not being \"demonised\" but rather regarded -- alongside the Western policy of appeasement -- as one of the direct causes of the of the Second World War. Although widely criticized since, the 1938 Munich agreement confined the recognition of Nazi territorial claims to Sudetenland; Ribbentrop-Molotov entitled Hitler to half of Europe.",

    "response": "A recurring disinformation narrative revising the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact (the Treaty of Non-Aggression between Germany and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) was signed on August 23, 1939. To the public pact of nonaggression was appended a secret protocol, which divided the whole of eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence. Poland east of the line formed by the Narew, Vistula, and San rivers would fall under the Soviet sphere of influence. The protocol also assigned Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Finland to the Soviet sphere of influence. In 1989, the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies condemned these protocols: \"The content of this treaty did not diverge with the norms of international law. However, during the signing of the treaty and in the process of its ratification the signature of an \"additional secret protocol\", which delimited the \"areas of interest\" of the parties from the Baltic to the Black Sea, from Finland to Bessarabia, was hidden.\" The original documents were burned by the Nazis at the end of the war, but a microfilm copy was saved and turned over to British and American authorities, who revealed its contents.

It aims to promote historical remembrance of the Second World War and is supported by a broad consensus on the causes of its outbreak. The \"Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact\" was accompanied by a secret supplementary protocol on the delimitation of areas of mutual interest in Eastern Europe. In particular, Hitler and Stalin agreed to divide Poland. The agreement also indicated that the Baltic states of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, as well as Bessarabia and Finland, also belonged to the respective areas of interest of Germany and the USSR. Just a week after the signing of the Pact, the German attack on Poland started World War II. Two weeks later, Soviet troops entered Polish territory. Later in 1939, Soviet Russia attacked Finland.

    "title": "Warsaw rewriting WWII history for propaganda purposes",
    "summary": "Polish officials are minimising the Soviet Union’s role in liberating Poland from the Nazis, in an attempt to rewrite the history of the Second World War for propaganda purposes.In an op-ed, Polish PM Morawiecki dubbed the Soviet Union a “facilitator” of the Nazi regime, glossing over the tens of millions of Soviet lives sacrificed in a war to topple fascism. Morawiecki also claimed that the Red Army “did not ‘liberate’ Warsaw, as the Russian authorities are now claiming.600,000 Soviet soldiers died in the liberation of Poland.",
    "response": "Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative distorting the events of the Second World War.In his op-ed, Morawiecki rightly notes that \"liberation of Warsaw\" is an overgenerous term, particularly in the context of Soviet actions before, during, and after the Second World War.On 17 September 1939, the USSR invaded and occupied the eastern half of Poland, in accordance with the provisions of the Nazi-Soviet Pact concluded the previous August and effective until summer 1941. During that time, Nazi and Soviet officials held regular joint conferences in occupied Poland, exchanging tips on how to deal with potential resistance posed by the Polish intelligentsia and military brass. By June 1941, the Soviet Union had managed to deport over 250,000 Poles to Siberia and Central Asia, murder 22,000 Polish Army officers and imprison half a million citizens.Long after the German invasion of Soviet territory, Moscow continued to deny support to the anti-Nazi resistance in Poland, most notably during the Warsaw Uprising which claimed 200,000 lives.After the Nazi defeat, the USSR installed a communist government in Warsaw, effectively delaying Polish independence until 1989.The claim that 600,000 Soviet troops died during the liberation of Poland is misleading and inconsistent with other Russian claims. A July 2017 statement by the Russian Foreign Ministry reads that this number pertains to Soviet casualties sustained \"in battles against the enemy on the territory of this country\" between 1944-45. The following month, Russia's ambassador in Poland said that the estimate concerns Red Army losses on present-day Polish territory, one-third of which belonged to the Third Reich before 1945. In 2019, Russia's Defence Ministry said that the number of fallen Soviet troops in the same period was actually 477,000, before bumping up their estimate to 600,000 in 2020, citing a new batch of \"archival documents.\"That said, the most significant Soviet operation which could be credited with \"liberating\" Poland from Nazism was the Vistula-Oder offensive, which resulted in the displacement of Nazi troops from Warsaw and other major Polish cities between 12 January and 2 February 1945. According to Soviet data, the operation claimed the lives of 43,251 Red Army troops. See this debunk for another example of pro-Kremlin outlets manipulating WW2 death statistics. 200,000 Soviet soldiers gave their lives, liberating Warsaw from Nazis",

It is true that part of its officers was replaced by the Red Army officers with the necessary experience, but the operational documents of this formation were issued in the Polish language.",
    "response": "This message is part of the Kremlin’s policy of historical revisionism – since 1944, the Soviet Union presented the “puppet” Polish Communist authorities and the USSR-controlled Polish People’s Army as independent and legitimate institutions representing the Polish nation.In 1943-1944, the Soviet authorities established the so-called “Polish Army” or the Polish People’s Army, which was formally subordinated to the USSR-controlled Polish Committee of National Liberation (PKWN). This step was a part of the Soviet political and propaganda strategy aimed at taking over national symbols and institutions associated with the independent Polish state. The establishment of the USSR-controlled Communist Government of Poland and the Polish People’s Army was used by the Soviet authorities for construction of a totalitarian Communist state in Poland in the after-war years.In March 1945, the share of the Soviet officers in the Polish People’s Army was about 52% - it is direct evidence for complete Soviet control over this military formation. The Polish People’s Army took part in the Soviet operations against the German troops on the territory of Poland, but its role was mainly symbolic.The very fact that the Red Army captured Warsaw and pushed the German troops out of Poland in 1945 does not mean that the USSR brought freedom to the Polish people. According to the statements of the Polish MFA, Poland respects the sacrifice of the Soviet soldiers in the fight with Nazism, but in 1945, Stalin's regime brought to Poland terror and atrocities. The Red Army liberated Warsaw from Nazi occupation but it didn’t mean liberty for Poland as the Soviet Army stayed in Poland for 48 years, which resulted in decades of communist oppression.According to mainstream Polish historians and views of the predominant part of Polish society, in 1944-1945, the USSR occupied Poland, establishing the undemocratic and repressive Communist Poland. De facto, Poland appeared under the Soviet military occupation until 1989, while the Russian troops were withdrawn from Poland only in 1993.See other examples referring to the Soviet occupation of Poland - It is thanks to Russia that Poland today exists as a country and the Red Army liberated Poland and preserved the country’s economic power.

    "response": "This message is part of Russian historical revisionism, portraying the Stalinist USSR as the peacemaker and liberator of Poland.By the beginning of 1945, as a result of the actions of Nazi troops, Warsaw lost up to 90% of its urban architecture. The rebuilding of the city took place throughout several post-war decades – the reconstruction of the Old Town was completed in the mid-1960s and the Royal Castle was finished only in 1984. Read more about the reconstruction of the Historic Centre of Warsaw here. The reconstruction of Warsaw, unprecedented in its scale, was a result of the massive effort of the entire Polish nation, not the Stalinist authorities.The statement that Joseph Stalin should be appreciated for the decision to rebuild the destroyed Warsaw is quite cynical. In fact, Stalin used the reconstruction of Warsaw for political goals, trying to receive international recognition before the Yalta Conference. The Poles accused Stalin and the USSR of refusing to support the Warsaw Uprising of 1944 when the Red Army was situated in closest proximity to Warsaw city centre, “observing” the destruction of the city by the Nazis. According to Norman Davies, there is a consensus among the majority of Polish and Western historians that it was a political decision of Stalin not to support the Uprising in order to let German troops destroy the forces of the Home Army (which tried to re-establish the independent Polish state).Read similar messages here: Stalin decided to establish the independent Polish state; It is thanks to Russia that Poland today exists as a country and The Red Army liberated Poland and preserved the country’s economic power.

    "summary": "The report of the American company Squire Patton Boggs, which substantiated the demolition of the monument to Marshal Konev in Prague, was of great importance for anti-Russian politicians in the Czech Republic. They write thousands of such reports every year. Of course, for the Czech political community, for their establishment, the report of a big American law firm is important. If the business took place in America, no one would pay such big attention to it – for them, it would be just a report of another lobbying company, albeit a large one. For the Czech Republic, a small country, which is largely dependent on the mood in Brussels and Washington, this is of great importance for them and has become one of the points of the PR campaign in the PR war around the monument to Marshal Konev. The Russian embassy will find out the role of the USA in the demolition of the monument to Konev. The Washington office of the company did not respond to requests. Apparently, they have something to hide.",
    "response": "This is a recurring disinformation narrative about the statue of Marshall Konev in Prague. It is also consistent with common pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about Russophobia and the supposedly hostile anti-Russian intentions of the West, based on which Russia can cast itself as the victim. The democratic decision to move the Konev statue to a museum has raised the ire of the Kremlin and even led Moscow to open a symbolic criminal case to investigate the alleged \"defiling of symbols of Russia's military glory.\" No supportive documents are given to prove the existence of an American law firm report about the statue of Marshall Konev in Prague. Even if such a report exists, it would not be binding for the democratically-elected local municipal council, which voted to the remove the statue in 2019. The leadership of Prague's Municipal District 6, which retains legal ownership of the statue, has voted to move the monument to a museum - not demolish it - and replace it with a memorial commemorating Soviet sacrifices in the fight against Hitler in general, and the liberation of Prague in particular. More information available here. In the dispute over the statue, Russia has argued that under the Czech-Russian mutual agreement of 1993, the Czech Republic is obliged to leave the statue in place on Prague's Interbrigade Square. However, this is an intentionally false and misleading interpretation of the terms of the agreement (full text available here). The monument is municipal property, belonging to city district Prague 6, and the 1993 agreement, therefore, does not apply to this case. The statue of Konev, erected in 1980, is not a military grave or memorial and therefore it was not protected by international treaties. The municipal council of Prague 6 voted for the removal of the statue. Basing on the protocol of the Politbureau's assembly, Czech historians established that on 8-14 May 1968, Konev chaired the Soviet military delegation sent to Prague to prepare the military invasion of Czechoslovakia. Konev was also chief of the Soviet troops in East Germany during the Berlin wall crisis in 1961. In other words, the Red Army brought not only liberation but also terror to the Czech Republic, as the mayor of Prague 6, Ondřej Kolář reminded. Kolář said that he respects the role of Konev-led forces in liberating Prague, and the sacrifice of Soviet armies liberating Europe from Nazism. \"We will strive for an art competition for a memorial to the liberators of Prague at the end of World War Two instead of the marshal Konev statue,\" he said before the vote. \"At the same time, we will secure a dignified - and let me stress that dignified - placement of this art piece (Konev) in a memorial institution.\" For similar cases, see here.",

    "summary": "Among the historical distortions commonly believed in the West is the notion that the Soviet Union colluded with Nazi Germany.It is true that the Germans and Soviets signed a Non-Aggression Pact in 1939, but it was not an alliance. In fact, the Soviets were not the only European country to have such an agreement since the French, British and even Polish had similar treaties with Germany dating from before 1939. The pact was meant to buy time for the Soviets, who were isolated under Western military pressure and sanctions, to defend themselves against an inevitable invasion.",
    "response": "The claim advances a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative distorting the events leading up to the Second World War, and accusing the West of historical revisionism.It is impossible to compare the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact with various agreements signed between Germany and other European countries throughout the 1930s. Crucially, the article does not mention that the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact of August 1939 contained a secret supplementary protocol that stipulated a coordinated Nazi-Soviet attack on Poland and the carving up of Eastern Europe between the USSR and The Third Reich. On the other hand, there is no historical evidence that any other pre-war agreements with Nazi Germany contained secret provisions of this kind and none had the devastating effects of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. See here for our debunking of the claim that the Soviet Union was \"forced\" to conclude an agreement with Hitler. Read more about the Pact here.See similar cases about the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact here, here, here, here and here. USSR did its utmost to create anti-Hitler coalition, the West left it to deal with Nazi Germany alone The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact played no role in unleashing World War II The Soviet Union was forced to sign the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact USSR was not an aggressor in World War 2, it was forced to sign the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact did not trigger World War II. Russia was threatened by Germany USSR is not to blame for the beginning of World War II",

This is another attempt to organise a hybrid Maidan revolution in Belarus. The previous attempt in 2010 was ended thanks to coordination between the Belarusian and Russian security bodies.

This false dilemma was repeatedly promoted in earlier disinformation cases here, here, and here. It should be noted that the recent presidental elections were considered neither free nor fair by the EU. In the past, the EU and US repeatedly introduced sanctions against Belarusian officials for mass violations of human rights and electoral standards, they have not attempted to stage a colour revolution in Belarus or any other country.

The same opinion piece contained other disinformation about the dismantling of the Konev monument in Prague, Western democracies preferring to co-operate with Hitler instead of the USSR in the 1930s and Poland cooperating with Hitler before the German attack on their country. Any disagreement with the official Kremlin’s view of the history of WWII is automatically labelled by Russia as support for “Nazism”. The perception of WWII history in the EU and the USA is based on facts, shared by the predominant majority of historians. Both Nazi Germany and the Stalinist USSR were harsh totalitarian regimes, which directly caused the deaths of tens of millions of people. These two regimes signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact with a Secret Supplementary Protocol, assuming the division of Poland and other Eastern European countries. The European Parliament resolution on the importance of European remembrance for the future of Europe stressed the fact that WWII was an immediate result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.

    "summary": "It is hard to understand how, in so many countries, it has been possible to twist and manipulate the Soviet participation in World War II. Given that the essential role of the Red Army in the war can’t be denied, it is admitted but adding as many layers of doubt and distance as possible, using puerile arguments such as that it was the cold that defeated the Nazis in Russian territory, as if German soldiers came from a tropical country. When talking about the arrival of the Red Army to Berlin, press articles often talk of the damage to civilians or the raping of German women by Soviet soldiers. But if we talk about D-Day and the landings in Normandy, no Western journalist would dare to tarnish the glory of the operation by mentioning US and British bombings against French civilians in the previous weeks and afterwards, which left dozens of thousands of civilians dead, much less the French women raped by US troops in the weeks after the landings. (See 05:00-06:20) […] While journalistic articles on WWII never fail to mention the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, always presented as a ‘carte blanche’ given by the Soviet Union to Hitler to start the conflict, the Munich Pact is never mentioned. In 1938, France and the United Kingdom signed an agreement allowing Hitler to annex almost 30 percent of Czechoslovakian territory, opening the expansionist appetite of the Third Reich. Months later, France and Germany signed a non-aggression agreement that cancelled the mutual assistance pact signed by Moscow and Paris three years before to stop Hitler’s expansionist ambitions. In August 1939, France and UK rejected a proposal for a triple alliance offered by the Soviets to contain Hitler. One week later, and only then, Ribbentrop and Molotov signed the agreement that now is presented as the only one. (See 06:40-08:20)",
    "response": "Recurrent pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative portraying accurate reporting on Soviet abuses during World War II as a smear campaign by Western media, in this case accusing them of tarnishing the glory of the Red Army's victory while obscuring misdeeds of Allied troops. This message is also part of the Kremlin’s policy of historical revisionism and an attempt to erode the disastrous historical role of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact by claiming that other European countries signed various international agreements with Germany after Adolf Hitler came into power. A quick internet search shows that many mainstream media have reported on the killing of civilians by allied bombings in Normandy. The same goes for the raping of French women by US soldiers after D-Day, which has been addressed by big outlets such as The New York Times, the Washington Post, US National Public Radio or Der Spiegel, just to name a few, as did many professional historians, while other outlets have reported on sexual abuses and raping by US troops in Germany. Official records show that US forces raped at least 14,000 women in Western Europe. By comparison, the actions of the Red Army in Germany have been described as the largest mass rape in history, with at least 1,5 million cases and massive documentary evidence. The big difference is that allied military authorities worked to prosecute many of the cases among its ranks (though often in racist processes which mostly punished black soldiers), while Soviet leadership tolerated the abuses. The argument that some Western media try to minimise the Soviet effort during the war by attributing the Nazi defeat in Russia to the cold is false. The article presented as an example, titled “Russia’s cold: the invincible weapon” and published in a Spanish magazine, addresses how the winter helped to defeat invasions by the Swedes, Napoleon and Hitler, but doesn’t claim that it was the only factor in the Russian victory. On the contrary, it explains how it was a liability for both sides in battles such as Stalingrad, though the Soviets were better adapted to it. However, it is well established that the weather was a crucial element in the failure of Operation Barbarossa, the Nazi invasion of the USSR, with the most severe subzero temperatures in several decades and the icy cold paralysing mechanised transport, tanks, artillery and aircraft and decimating German troops that had expected a quick victory in a few weeks and were ill-prepared for such a winter campaign. It is impossible to compare the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact with various agreements signed between Germany and other European countries throughout the 1930s. There is no historical evidence that these agreements contained any secret protocols, which assumed common aggressive actions of Germany and these countries against third parties.

The EU project itself was part of their work against Nazism, believing that by establishing a political and economic union between European countries they can ensure that ideologies such as Nazism never rise again.Russia has systematically sought to revise history to instil a deceptive misperception that only Russia fought against Hitler in World War II and draw manipulative parallels with Russia’s present-day aggression against Ukraine. See our series of articles about historical revisionism and world War II.Pro-Kremlin media outlets are also known for manipulating historical events to promote the narrative that Western countries have, for centuries, formed an anti-Russian alliance. In doing so, they often ignore past conflicts and rivalries among these nations and conflate modern-day Russia with both the Soviet Union and the Russian Empire in a historically questionable manner. See our article Rewriting history: the myth of Russia’s invincibility.Finally, the ongoing war in Ukraine was not launched by or is continuing because of the NATO. Russia is the only country responsible for the invasion of Ukraine. It was Putin’s personal decision to invade Ukraine and start the largest military conflict in Europe since WWII. Russia has been coming up with different explanations and pretexts for its aggression since the beginning of its hostilities.Read similar cases in our database claiming that the EU is openly reviving Nazism in Europe the European Union wants to openly revive the ideology of Nazism, that the European Union is openly seeking to revive Nazism, that the EU glorifies Nazism, that Nazism not yet eradicated despite victory in WWII, or that the European Union justifies Nazism.

    "summary": "A number of Western institutions and persons tend to say dark is bright and to equalise WWII losers with winners. The end goal of such campaigns is to weaken and even destroy Russia. For Russians, their future is at stake in the struggle for historical truth about the victory over Nazism.",
    "response": "This message is consistent with recurring pro-Kremlin propaganda narrative about anti-Russian policies of aggressive West. It is also part of the Kremlin’s policy of historical revisionism which attempts to portray Russia's role in World War II as non-aggressive and to blame the West for the failure to create an anti-Nazi coalition with the Soviet Union. The article attempts to minimise and erode the disastrous historical role of the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact, saying: \"In these circumstances, the Soviet Union signed the Non-Aggression Pact with Germany. It was practically the last among the European countries to do so. Besides, it was done in the face of a real threat of war on two fronts – with Germany in the west and with Japan in the east, where intense fighting on the Khalkhin Gol River was already underway.\" In the same context, see other examples of Russian disinformation narratives on World War II, such as claims that Western countries revise history to avoid responsibility for allowing Hitler to attack the USSR or that the Soviet Union tried to create an anti-Nazi alliance but the West didn’t respond or that the USSR had no role in the outbreak of the war. USSR made enormous efforts to create an anti-Nazi alliance with Western states before WWII, but the latter failed to support this idea Western countries revise WWII history to evade responsibility for allowing Hitler to gather strength for the attack on the USSR USSR made enormous efforts to create an anti-Nazi alliance with Western states before WWII, but the latter failed to support this idea It is a lie, that the USSR along with Germany is responsible for the outbreak of the WWII",

    "response": "This message is an example of a narrative shift about the two world wars. Kremlin's policy of historical revisionism stands on the attempts to undermine or deny Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact on the one hand and on another hand on accusing European countries of cooperating with Nazi Germany. In this case, Germany is portrayed as a victim of European countries, which was dragged into the war unwillingly. \"The Anglo-Saxons\" have appeared as a \"go-to bogeyman\" for pro-Kremlin disinformation outlets; an evil force behind all geopolitical processes.Neither WWI nor WWII has nothing to do with \"Anglo-Saxon intrigues\". Multiple reasons are cited as the cause of WWI: nationalism, militarism, mutual defence alliances, colonial policy and the killing of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. A final green light for unleashing WWII for Nazi Germany was a non-aggression pact between Germany and the Soviet Union. German troops invaded Poland on September 1, 1939. On September 17, 1939, Soviet troops entered eastern Poland. USSR and Nazi Germany even held a common military parade in Brest-Litovsk.Read more about the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact: Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact: A 'honeymoon' for two dictators (Deutsche Welle); The Night Stalin and Hitler Redrew the Map of Europe (RFERL).",

    "response": "Recurrent narrative about the Western countries trying to rewrite history to serve a political agenda, whereas Russia would favour historical truth without second thought. Archives of WWII are not secret in western countries. Historians can have access to them, and even general public. In France, for instance, since the opinion was published by RT France, all archives related to WWII are open without any pre-approval since the decree opening archives relating to the Second World War of 24.12.2015. Before archives were accessible with derogation since 1997, 1998 (national Archives) and 2002 (district Archives). A vast program of declassification of Secret Defence archives was initiated. In Russia president Putin announced on January 15th 2020 a vast program to make accessible documents of archives. Since May 2020, the first part of those archive are visible on the presidential library. However, in today Russia it can be dangerous to publicly share or like archive documents or historical facts. In 2018 the international human right association Agora published a report about people who were prosecuted. They included 100 cases of prosecutions and prohibitions under the pretext of protecting against falsification of history. Over the previous ten years, lawyers have recorded 17 criminal cases (16 defendants were found guilty), 18 administrative cases, 41 cases of the prohibition of books and online publications and their inclusion in the list of extremist materials, as well as examples of refusals to provide archival materials. In conclusion, it cannot be said that archives are open in Russia and closed in western countries and To know more about the untruths conveyed by the article published in the National Interest and Rossiyskaya Gazeta you can read 5 examples.",

The claim advances a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative distorting the events leading up to the Second World War, denying the USSR responsibility for starting WWII after signing the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in 1939.Poland lost its sovereignty and statehood not only because of Nazi Germany but also of the aggressive policy of their then ally - the USSR. In accordance with the secret terms of the Nazi-Soviet pact, the Red Army crossed the Polish border from the east on 17 September 1939. Poland was divided between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.The signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was a mutual decision of two totalitarian regimes (Nazi Germany and the Stalinist USSR) aimed at the division of Eastern and Central Europe between these two powers. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact contained the Secret Supplementary Protocol, which assumed the division of Poland and other Eastern European countries between the USSR and Germany. The signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact enabled the German and Soviet military aggression against Poland in September 1939, which resulted in the occupation of this country by Germany and the USSR, triggering the beginning of WWII.The decision to pass Silesia, part of East Prussia, and other former German territories to the Polish state was made by the USA, the UK, and the USSR at the Yalta Conference and the Potsdam Conference.
